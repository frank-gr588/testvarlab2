1
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,830
Just get me home.

2
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,110
Just get me home.

3
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,710
I'll do the rest.

4
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,710
Yes, hello, this is David Linn
from <i>The New York Times.</i>

5
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,440
May I speak with Susan,
please? Thank you.

6
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,320
Hi, Susan, it's David again.

7
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,630
I was just calling to see if we can set--

8
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,000
Well, yes. Well, I figured
we'd have to do the interview by phone,

9
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,200
since they've already left New York.

10
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,080
But what we'd really love to get
is a photo of Mr. and Mrs. Schwartz

11
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,270
to go along with the article.

12
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,150
When are they scheduled
to get home?

13
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:58,320
Oh, so they'll be home
tonight. Gotcha.

14
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:03,510
Now, the address I have on them
is Upper Canyon Road. Is that still...?

15
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,830
No, it isn't. They've--
Oh, let me get a pen.

16
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,920
Where do they...?

17
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,990
Tesuque. I see.

18
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,990
And the address?

19
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,600
Is that up near the opera house?
I hear that's nice.

20
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,910
Well, I'll be in contact
with my photographer

21
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,120
to check on his schedule.

22
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,120
No, no, it's their call.

23
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,960
I know how busy
Mr. and Mrs. Schwartz are.

24
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,510
Thank you.

25
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,040
This should make one hell of a story.

26
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,320
Goodbye.

27
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,190
<i>I'm just saying,
it's apples and oranges.</i>

28
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,830
Listen, I maintain,

29
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,470
if I want pizza,

30
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,440
I go to a pizza place.
Yeah.

31
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,590
If I want Thai,
I go to a Thai place.

32
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,800
What is the point in comparing
Did I marry you?

33
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,240
pizza to Thai?
What has happened?

34
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,520
- This is different.
- They're completely--

35
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,040
Oh, come on,
are you the man I married?

36
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,240
I am the guy who wants to end
this ridiculous conversation,

37
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,870
kick off my shoes, and have
a very large glass of wine.

38
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,160
Well, I'm gonna tell you
to be my guest.

39
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,960
All right, wait.

40
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,160
The answer is 21.

41
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,830
No.
Yes.

42
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,390
Yes, because it has history.

43
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,040
Come on.

44
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,600
Prohibition.

45
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,190
The <i>Sweet Smell of Success.</i>

46
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,150
And Per Se has Thomas Keller.

47
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,590
Game, set, and match.

48
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,750
The whole vibe is so Yountville.

49
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,910
You transplant it to Manhattan--

50
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,680
Transplant it to Islamabad,
I would eat there.

51
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,270
Oh, there's a good thought.

52
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,480
What, Islamabad?

53
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,400
No, Napa. We have to go to Napa.

54
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,000
Oh, my God, all this talk of food.
Do you think Juana left us anything?

55
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,560
She doesn't think we're coming back
until Wednesday.

56
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,360
Unless you told her.
No, I haven't talked to her.

57
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,720
Oh, look, here.

58
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,400
Just a pear, that'll be perfect.
Yeah.

59
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,830
You wanna get us
a nice bottle of wine?

60
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,110
Mm-hm.

61
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,310
Do you think we have any of those--?

62
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,910
What are those crackers with,
like, the sun-dried tomato,

63
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,390
and they were slightly peppery,
but not too peppery.

64
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,080
- We don't have them?
- No.

65
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,960
Ask Juana.

66
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,430
We haven't had them in forever.

67
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,150
I don't know why she doesn't get those.
Why don't you talk to her?

68
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,520
She's got that thing with her daughter.

69
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,750
Anyway, Napa?
Yeah.

70
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,160
How long since we've been?
Two years.

71
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,190
Jesus, that's two years.

72
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,590
Yeah, too long, right?
Is this okay?

73
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,520
Oh, that looks <i>p e r fe c to.</i>

74
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,680
You wanna get the fireplace?

75
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,120
Is it good?
Mm-hm.

76
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,920
Is it ripe?
Mm-hm.

77
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,280
Yeah.

78
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,920
We could invite George and Delores.
They could come up from Marin.

79
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,070
And Bill and Miriam Cohen.

80
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:16,040
We could have a little
spa action, right?

81
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,470
And then we could do
some sort of wine, and then--

82
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,030
Hello, Gretchen.

83
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,190
Elliott.

84
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,520
I really like your new house.

85
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,350
Walt.

86
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,230
This...

87
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,760
Are we looking east?

88
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,830
Oh...

89
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,800
My God, you must have one great view
of the Sangre de Cristos.

90
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,040
Walt,

91
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,590
what are you doing here?

92
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,760
I saw you on <i>Charlie Rose.</i>

93
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,320
You looked great.

94
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,950
You both did.
If you are here to--

95
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,110
To hurt us--

96
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,280
Walt, whatever it is
you're planning--

97
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,160
Actually, I'm here
to give you something.

98
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,560
It's out in my car.

99
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:33,310
How about the three of us take a walk
to it? It's just parked down the road.

100
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,040
I couldn't get it past your gate.

101
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,640
Elliott, if we're gonna go that way,

102
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,320
you'll need a bigger knife.

103
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,920
Keep stacking. It'll all fit.

104
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,270
That's all right.

105
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,710
Yeah, just throw it on top.

106
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,240
Gretchen, would you mind? We don't
want to lose any under the furniture.

107
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,110
All right.

108
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,310
That is $9,720,000.

109
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,080
Where did it come from?
And why is it here?

110
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,870
I earned it, and you're going to
give it to my children.

111
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,950
What? Why?
Walt, I don't think we--

112
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,030
On my son's 18th birthday,

113
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,990
which is 10 months
and two days from today,

114
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,150
you will give him this money,

115
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,440
in the form of an irrevocable trust.

116
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,470
You will tell him that it is his
to do with as he sees fit,

117
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:02,510
but with the hope that he uses it
for his college education.

118
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,910
And for the betterment of his family.
Walt, I'm not sure that we follow.

119
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,790
Why...?

120
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,320
I mean, why, in particular,
would we--?

121
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,630
If you wanna give your kids
drug money, go do it yourself.

122
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,150
I can't.

123
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,550
My wife and son hate me.

124
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,280
They won't take my money.

125
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,950
Even if they did,

126
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,110
the federal government
wouldn't let them.

127
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:33,280
But two rich benefactors who are known
for their charitable endeavors,

128
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,600
who would think nothing of,
for instance, writing a $28 million check,

129
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,390
to help victims
of methamphetamine abuse?

130
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,790
I have to think that your money
would be very welcome.

131
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,240
It wouldn't make any sense
coming from us.

132
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,120
It certainly would.

133
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,800
My children are blameless victims
of their monstrous father.

134
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,520
A man who you once knew
quite well.

135
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,160
Call it a beau geste,
call it liberal guilt,

136
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,550
call it whatever you want, but do it.

137
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:15,120
And you are not to spend
a single dime of your own money.

138
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:21,440
If there are taxes or lawyers' fees owed,
you will take it right from here.

139
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,120
They use my money, never yours.

140
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,960
Okay, Walt, sure.

141
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,000
That sounds reasonable.

142
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,360
So, what happens next?

143
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,910
I guess we shake on it,
and I leave.

144
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,880
I can trust you to do this.

145
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,390
Yes.

146
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,550
Absolutely, you can.

147
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,310
Don't move. Don't--
Don't dare move a muscle.

148
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,920
You don't want them to think that
you're trying to get away. Just breathe.

149
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,190
Just this afternoon,
I had an extra $200,000

150
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,080
that I would have loved dearly
to leave on top of this table.

151
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:55,360
Instead, I gave it to the two best
hit men west of the Mississippi.

152
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,640
Now,

153
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,680
whatever happens to me tomorrow,

154
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,350
they'll still be out there.

155
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,080
Keeping tabs.

156
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,840
And if,

157
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,270
for any reason,

158
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,400
that my children
do not get this money,

159
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,070
a kind of countdown
will begin.

160
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,870
Maybe a day or so later,
maybe a week, a year,

161
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:30,830
when you're going for a walk in Santa
Fe or Manhattan or Prague, wherever,

162
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,600
and you're talking
about your stock prices

163
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,670
without a worry in the world.

164
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,990
And then suddenly,

165
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,310
you'll hear the scrape
of a footstep behind you,

166
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,520
but before you can
even turn around:

167
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,800
Pop!

168
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,630
Darkness.

169
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,750
Cheer up, beautiful people.

170
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,360
This is where you get to make it right.

171
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,120
Oh, yeah, right.

172
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,550
You know, I don't exactly know
how to feel about all this.

173
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,880
For real, yo.

174
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:20,160
Whole thing felt kind of shady,
you know, like, morality-wise?

175
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,310
Totally.

176
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,990
How do you feel now?

177
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,710
Better.
Yeah, definitely improving.

178
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,070
What's this I hear

179
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,440
about blue meth
still being out there?

180
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,680
What do you mean?

181
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,600
Have you heard anything?

182
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,070
Is it still being sold?

183
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,840
Yeah.

184
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,310
By whom?

185
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,840
It's you, right?

186
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,590
I mean, aren't you
still cooking?

187
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,280
Damn, man.

188
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,000
We were sure it was you,

189
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,550
because that shit is choice, yo.

190
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,950
Better than ever.

191
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,240
I mean, um, you know.

192
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,080
Jesse.
Seriously?

193
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,640
You said he moved to Alaska.
That's what I heard.

194
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,030
Right on, Jesse.

195
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,750
Passing the torch.

196
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,630
Damn, man, couldn't he at least
throw a brother a bone?

197
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,080
Whoa, what happened there?

198
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,470
It's my birthday.

199
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,030
Yeah? Well, happy birthday.

200
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:07,510
It's easy money. Till we catch you. Say
the word, I'll take you on a ride-along.

201
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,350
You can watch us
knock down a meth lab.

202
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,480
Get a little excitement
in your life. Heh, heh.

203
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,360
Yeah, someday.

204
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,560
Welcome. Would you like a menu?
No, thank you.

205
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,270
Chamomile tea with soy milk, please.
All right, you got it.

206
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,150
Hey, how you doing?

207
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,910
Good.

208
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,390
How's things?

209
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,110
Hey, I like your...

210
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,840
Shirt.

211
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,830
My blouse?
Nice. Yeah, I like the color.

212
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,830
That's a nice color on you.

213
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,510
It's kind of a--

214
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:29,440
I don't know exactly what you'd call it.
It's kind of a cornflower blue.

215
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,990
Before you say or do anything,
just hear me out.

216
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,360
Todd.
Nobody knows that I'm here.

217
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:40,880
Just listen for two minutes,
and then I'll leave. Please.

218
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,560
No. Please.

219
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,160
Just two minutes of your time.
That's all I ask.

220
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,320
Please.

221
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,110
You're running out of
methylamine, aren't you?

222
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,480
I can do the math.

223
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,110
You've been at it long enough.
You must be running low.

224
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,000
I have a new method

225
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,120
that requires no methylamine.

226
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,870
It's easy, and it will keep you in business.
And, Todd, I could teach it to you.

227
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,640
How did you know
to find us here?

228
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,800
Ten a.m.

229
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,150
Every Tuesday morning,
you and I met here.

230
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,840
You're rather
schedule-oriented, I guess.

231
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,550
Sorry.

232
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,360
I need the money.

233
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,950
I've spent almost all of mine already,

234
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:00,150
just trying to stay
one step ahead of the police.

235
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,040
Mr. White, I don't think there's--

236
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,190
How much would it cost us?

237
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,750
Nothing short of a million.

238
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,070
And believe me, for this,

239
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,190
that is giving it away.

240
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,920
I think Jack should hear this.

241
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,400
Yeah, I don't know.

242
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:24,710
Now, listen, I can come up
there tonight and talk to him.

243
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,630
He'd get it.

244
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,790
This is a win-win situation.

245
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,280
Hi, what can I get for you two?
He's just leaving.

246
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,160
Good seeing you again.
Take care.

247
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,270
For you?

248
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,510
I'm good.

249
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,910
And I need more stevia.

250
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,870
Okay, no disrespect to the man,
but doing business with him?

251
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,080
Right now, that's not--

252
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,040
Of course we're not
doing business with him.

253
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,150
Todd, please.

254
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,520
Don't make me walk you through this.

255
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,590
Jesus. Did you look at him?

256
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,550
You'd be doing him a favor.

257
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,960
<i>Hello, please record after the tone.</i>

258
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,200
<i>Truce, all right?</i>

259
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,470
<i>Skyler, I have news about Walt,
and you need to hear it,</i>

260
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,760
<i>so if you're there, pick up.</i>

261
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,480
<i>Skyler--</i>

262
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,280
Hey.

263
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,710
What's up?

264
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,630
<i>Walt's in town.</i>

265
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,360
Yeah?

266
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,120
That car they thought he stole
in New Hampshire,

267
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,480
they found it in a Denny's
parking lot right on Central.

268
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,110
<i>And your next-door neighbor,
on the right-- What's her name, Becky?</i>

269
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:41,830
Becky's on the left. Carol's on the right.
<i>Becky, Carol, whatever.</i>

270
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,470
<i>She saw him at your old house.</i>

271
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,830
Just this morning, plain as day.

272
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,550
He's there, walking out of your house,
and he calls her by name.

273
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:56,110
He didn't hurt her, did he? He didn't--?
No, he's just like, "Hey, Becky!"

274
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,040
Or Carol, whatever.

275
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,640
<i>She said he looked exactly
like the Unabomber.</i>

276
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,560
But she's positive it was him.
They're getting calls from all over town.

277
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,680
He's here, he's there,
he's going to blow up city hall.

278
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,880
He has some sort of manifesto.
He wants to be on the news.

279
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,550
Who's making these calls? Him?
<i>There are two or three voices.</i>

280
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,400
<i>They're not sure if they're crank calls
or people he's put up to it,</i>

281
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,600
<i>or if they're actual anonymous tips.</i>

282
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,630
<i>It's stretching them thin,
which is maybe the point.</i>

283
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,150
<i>As far as I'm concerned,</i>

284
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,230
there are three places that he would go:
To you, to me, or Flynn.

285
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,960
<i>Right.</i>

286
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,870
They're watching the high school.

287
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,270
They're probably watching
your place too.

288
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,990
I mean,

289
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,270
I know that's what Hank would do.

290
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:47,150
There is no way Walt's getting to you.
They are absolutely going to catch him.

291
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,440
No doubt about it.

292
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,440
That arrogant asshole thinks he's some
criminal mastermind, but he's not.

293
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,030
<i>But on the off chance...</i>

294
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,110
Yeah.

295
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:01,070
On the million-to-one chance,

296
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,950
you be on the lookout, okay?

297
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,030
Thanks.

298
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,800
You got it.

299
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,270
Five minutes.

300
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,030
Five minutes.

301
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,670
You didn't kill anybody
sneaking in here, did you?

302
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,080
You didn't hurt anybody?
No.

303
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,190
Didn't have to.

304
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,950
You look terrible.

305
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,070
Yeah.

306
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,030
But I feel good.

307
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,910
So talk.

308
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,870
Why are you here?

309
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,310
It's over.

310
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,070
And I needed
a proper goodbye.

311
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,310
Not our last phone call.

312
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,680
So you're going to the police?

313
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,630
They'll be coming to me.

314
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,240
If you're in custody,

315
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,200
what stops those people
from coming back?

316
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,920
When--

317
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,520
When I still had the house,

318
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,240
three men came
in the middle of the night,

319
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,150
wearing masks, threatening
Holly and Flynn and me.

320
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,520
They told me not to talk about
that woman at the car wash,

321
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,480
and if you're in custody--

322
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,600
They're not coming back.
Not after tonight.

323
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,430
What's tonight?

324
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,470
We don't want your money, Walt.

325
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,120
I thought Flynn made that clear.

326
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,950
He did.

327
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,120
And I don't have any to give you.

328
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,390
I spent the last of it getting here.

329
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,920
All I have to give you

330
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,430
is this.

331
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,870
Call the DEA once I leave.

332
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:12,240
Tell them I was here.
That I forced my way in.

333
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,990
Tell them...

334
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:21,040
Tell them I wanted
bacon and eggs on my birthday,

335
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,400
and that I gave you that ticket.

336
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,990
Those numbers
are GPS coordinates.

337
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,630
For what?

338
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,520
A burial site.

339
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,680
That's where they'll
find Hank and Steve Gomez.

340
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,800
It's where I buried our money.

341
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,360
And the men who stole it from us,

342
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,720
the men who still have it,

343
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,710
they murdered Hank and Steve

344
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,950
and put them in that hole.

345
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,550
Now, you trade that

346
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,160
for a deal with the prosecutor.

347
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,990
You get yourself out of this.

348
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,070
Skyler.

349
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,510
Skyler.

350
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,200
All the things that I did,

351
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:25,080
you need to understand--
If I have to hear

352
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,440
one more time

353
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,560
that you did this for the family--

354
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,840
I did it for me.

355
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,440
I liked it.

356
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,960
I was good at it.

357
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,280
And

358
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,790
I was

359
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,600
really...

360
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,670
I was alive.

361
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,640
Flynn will be home soon.

362
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,070
Before I go,

363
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,750
may I see her?

364
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,080
Whoo.

365
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,880
Damn, man, this thing's a classic.

366
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,190
What block you got in it?

367
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,350
The 500 or the 425?

368
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,160
Couldn't tell you.

369
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,630
Well...

370
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,870
Five hundred.

371
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,040
That's the one you want.

372
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,430
No replacement for displacement.

373
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,070
Where to?

374
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,280
To the clubhouse.

375
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,640
Go ahead, just park it
right in front over here.

376
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,880
No, no, no, just straight in, man.
Just-- What are--?

377
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,720
All right, fine, here, whatever.

378
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,710
Hey, how you doing?

379
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,110
Turn around,
put your arms out like this.

380
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,720
While you're at it,
why don't you lift your shirt up,

381
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,240
give us a spin?

382
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,710
Christ, I'm not wearing a wire.

383
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,190
Okay?

384
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,840
My wallet and keys?
Yeah, you'll get them back. Just relax.

385
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,350
Stay here.

386
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,640
Keep your eyes open.

387
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,840
Jesus, look at you with
that head of hair. Is that real?

388
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,400
Yes.

389
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,830
That's not a wig? Seriously?
No.

390
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,520
What were you doing before,
shaving it?

391
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,520
Yes.

392
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,510
Christ, that is one fine
head of hair.

393
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,990
I mean, otherwise,
you look like shit, but--

394
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,630
Hello to you too, Jack.
Now, can we talk business?

395
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,870
I don't think so, no.

396
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,110
Did Todd tell you what I'm offering?
Yeah, he told me.

397
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:44,190
The thing is
we're not really in the market.

398
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,590
You're low on methylamine.
What happens then?

399
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,550
No, we'll get more.

400
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,070
That Quayle woman's got her own setup.
The heat's off her.

401
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,550
She can break loose a barrel.
It ain't broke, so why fix it?

402
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,440
Todd, please, would you
explain things to your uncle?

403
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,160
Explain to him the benefit
of what I'm offering.

404
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,870
You really shouldn't
have come back, Mr. White.

405
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,830
I'm sorry.

406
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,790
Wait. Jack.
Where do you want it?

407
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,320
I don't know,
anywhere but my living room?

408
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,150
Take him out back.
Jack, look, you owe me.

409
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,720
You owe me.
Hey, hey, hey.

410
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,470
Let's go.
I owe you, what for?

411
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:30,030
Jesse Pinkman. You promised
you would kill him, and you didn't.

412
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,510
Instead, you partnered with him.
All right.

413
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,800
You're his partner now--
Whoa, stop.

414
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,800
Partners? What are you
talking about?

415
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,440
He's alive, isn't he?

416
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,590
He's cooking for you.

417
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,430
What, are you gonna lie?

418
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,390
Him being alive
is not him and me being partners.

419
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,310
Not by a damn sight.

420
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,230
What, you think
I'd partner with a rat?

421
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,800
Where is that little piece of shit?

422
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,480
He's finishing up a batch.

423
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,280
Go get him. Bring him here.

424
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,550
Uncle Jack--
No. No, no, no.

425
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,030
This one here, calling me a liar?

426
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,110
He just insulted you,
he insulted me, all of us.

427
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,240
Jesus. Hustle it up. Come on.
Let's get this over with.

428
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,800
I'm gonna show you
just how wrong you are.

429
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,360
Then I'm putting that bullet
in your head myself.

430
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,990
Yeah, you see what I'm
talking about, you son of a bitch?

431
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,760
Now, does this look
like a partner to you?

432
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,870
Come here. Take a look.

433
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,080
Come here!

434
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,360
Take a look at him.

435
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,630
Have a gander.

436
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,920
This is my partner.

437
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,830
Right, partner? Right, buddy?

438
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,510
Hardworking, good partner.
Fifty-fifty partner.

439
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,320
Can you hurry this shit up?

440
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,840
Make it quick?

441
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,510
Toddy, get him off, would you?
Yeah, Toddy, get them both off.

442
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,280
Uncle Jack.

443
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,480
Jesus.

444
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,470
Mr. White.

445
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,430
Wait. Wait.

446
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,710
You want your money, right?

447
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:28,000
You wanna know where it is?

448
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,680
You pull that trigger, you'll never--

449
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,190
Do it.

450
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,920
You want this.

451
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,310
Say the words.

452
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:41,670
Say you want this!

453
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:46,520
Nothing happens until I hear you say it.

454
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,910
I want this.

455
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,680
Then do it yourself.

456
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,960
Pick up the phone.

457
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:53,750
<i>Hello?</i>

458
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,190
Is it done?

459
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,870
Is he gone?

460
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,110
<i>Yeah, it's done.</i>

461
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,520
<i>He's gone.</i>

462
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,270
<i>They're all gone.</i>

463
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,630
Todd? Who is this?

464
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,150
It's Walt.

465
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,910
How are you feeling?

466
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,870
Kind of under the weather?

467
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,760
Like you've got the flu?

468
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,070
That would be
the ricin I gave you.

469
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:26,790
<i>I slipped it into that stevia crap
that you're always putting in your tea.</i>

470
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,800
Oh, my God.

471
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,800
Well,

472
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,070
goodbye, Lydia.
