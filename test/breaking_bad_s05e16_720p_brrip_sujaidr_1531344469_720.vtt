NOTE  Mama

0:02:07.360 --> 0:02:09.830
Just get me home.

0:02:11.960 --> 0:02:14.110
Just get me home.

0:02:14.320 --> 0:02:16.710
I'll do the rest.

0:05:19.560 --> 0:05:22.710
Yes, hello, this is David Linn
from <i>The New York Times.</i>

0:05:22.920 --> 0:05:26.440
May I speak with Susan,
please? Thank you.

0:05:30.120 --> 0:05:32.320
Hi, Susan, it's David again.

0:05:32.480 --> 0:05:35.630
I was just calling to see if we can set--

0:05:35.800 --> 0:05:40.000
Well, yes. Well, I figured
we'd have to do the interview by phone,

0:05:40.160 --> 0:05:42.200
since they've already left New York.

0:05:42.400 --> 0:05:46.080
But what we'd really love to get
is a photo of Mr. and Mrs. Schwartz

0:05:46.280 --> 0:05:48.270
to go along with the article.

0:05:48.440 --> 0:05:52.150
When are they scheduled
to get home?

0:05:53.640 --> 0:05:58.320
Oh, so they'll be home
tonight. Gotcha.

0:05:58.480 --> 0:06:03.510
Now, the address I have on them
is Upper Canyon Road. Is that still...?

0:06:03.680 --> 0:06:06.830
No, it isn't. They've--
Oh, let me get a pen.

0:06:07.960 --> 0:06:09.920
Where do they...?

0:06:10.080 --> 0:06:12.990
Tesuque. I see.

0:06:13.160 --> 0:06:14.990
And the address?

0:06:17.320 --> 0:06:21.600
Is that up near the opera house?
I hear that's nice.

0:06:22.440 --> 0:06:24.910
Well, I'll be in contact
with my photographer

0:06:25.080 --> 0:06:27.120
to check on his schedule.

0:06:27.320 --> 0:06:29.120
No, no, it's their call.

0:06:30.080 --> 0:06:32.960
I know how busy
Mr. and Mrs. Schwartz are.

0:06:33.160 --> 0:06:34.510
Thank you.

0:06:34.680 --> 0:06:38.040
This should make one hell of a story.

0:06:38.200 --> 0:06:40.320
Goodbye.

0:06:55.560 --> 0:06:59.190
<i>I'm just saying,
it's apples and oranges.</i>

0:07:00.080 --> 0:07:01.830
Listen, I maintain,

0:07:02.000 --> 0:07:04.470
if I want pizza,

0:07:04.640 --> 0:07:06.440
I go to a pizza place.
Yeah.

0:07:06.600 --> 0:07:09.590
If I want Thai,
I go to a Thai place.

0:07:09.760 --> 0:07:13.800
What is the point in comparing
Did I marry you?

0:07:13.960 --> 0:07:16.240
pizza to Thai?
What has happened?

0:07:16.400 --> 0:07:18.520
- This is different.
- They're completely--

0:07:18.680 --> 0:07:21.040
Oh, come on,
are you the man I married?

0:07:21.200 --> 0:07:25.240
I am the guy who wants to end
this ridiculous conversation,

0:07:25.400 --> 0:07:28.870
kick off my shoes, and have
a very large glass of wine.

0:07:29.040 --> 0:07:33.160
Well, I'm gonna tell you
to be my guest.

0:07:34.920 --> 0:07:35.960
All right, wait.

0:07:36.120 --> 0:07:40.160
The answer is 21.

0:07:40.320 --> 0:07:41.830
No.
Yes.

0:07:42.000 --> 0:07:44.390
Yes, because it has history.

0:07:44.560 --> 0:07:46.040
Come on.

0:07:46.200 --> 0:07:47.600
Prohibition.

0:07:47.760 --> 0:07:49.190
The <i>Sweet Smell of Success.</i>

0:07:49.400 --> 0:07:51.150
And Per Se has Thomas Keller.

0:07:51.360 --> 0:07:52.590
Game, set, and match.

0:07:52.760 --> 0:07:54.750
The whole vibe is so Yountville.

0:07:54.920 --> 0:07:56.910
You transplant it to Manhattan--

0:07:57.120 --> 0:07:59.680
Transplant it to Islamabad,
I would eat there.

0:07:59.840 --> 0:08:01.270
Oh, there's a good thought.

0:08:01.440 --> 0:08:02.480
What, Islamabad?

0:08:02.680 --> 0:08:04.400
No, Napa. We have to go to Napa.

0:08:04.560 --> 0:08:08.000
Oh, my God, all this talk of food.
Do you think Juana left us anything?

0:08:10.200 --> 0:08:12.560
She doesn't think we're coming back
until Wednesday.

0:08:12.760 --> 0:08:15.360
Unless you told her.
No, I haven't talked to her.

0:08:15.520 --> 0:08:17.720
Oh, look, here.

0:08:17.880 --> 0:08:20.400
Just a pear, that'll be perfect.
Yeah.

0:08:20.600 --> 0:08:22.830
You wanna get us
a nice bottle of wine?

0:08:23.040 --> 0:08:24.110
Mm-hm.

0:08:24.320 --> 0:08:26.310
Do you think we have any of those--?

0:08:26.520 --> 0:08:29.910
What are those crackers with,
like, the sun-dried tomato,

0:08:30.080 --> 0:08:33.390
and they were slightly peppery,
but not too peppery.

0:08:33.560 --> 0:08:36.080
- We don't have them?
- No.

0:08:36.920 --> 0:08:37.960
Ask Juana.

0:08:38.200 --> 0:08:39.430
We haven't had them in forever.

0:08:39.600 --> 0:08:43.150
I don't know why she doesn't get those.
Why don't you talk to her?

0:08:43.320 --> 0:08:45.520
She's got that thing with her daughter.

0:08:45.680 --> 0:08:47.750
Anyway, Napa?
Yeah.

0:08:47.960 --> 0:08:50.160
How long since we've been?
Two years.

0:08:50.360 --> 0:08:52.190
Jesus, that's two years.

0:08:52.360 --> 0:08:54.590
Yeah, too long, right?
Is this okay?

0:08:54.800 --> 0:08:56.520
Oh, that looks <i>p e r fe c to.</i>

0:08:56.720 --> 0:08:59.680
You wanna get the fireplace?

0:09:00.840 --> 0:09:02.120
Is it good?
Mm-hm.

0:09:02.280 --> 0:09:03.920
Is it ripe?
Mm-hm.

0:09:04.080 --> 0:09:06.280
Yeah.

0:09:06.480 --> 0:09:09.920
We could invite George and Delores.
They could come up from Marin.

0:09:10.080 --> 0:09:12.070
And Bill and Miriam Cohen.

0:09:12.280 --> 0:09:16.040
We could have a little
spa action, right?

0:09:16.240 --> 0:09:18.470
And then we could do
some sort of wine, and then--

0:09:27.960 --> 0:09:30.030
Hello, Gretchen.

0:09:30.200 --> 0:09:32.190
Elliott.

0:09:33.960 --> 0:09:36.520
I really like your new house.

0:09:38.680 --> 0:09:40.350
Walt.

0:09:42.240 --> 0:09:44.230
This...

0:09:50.720 --> 0:09:52.760
Are we looking east?

0:09:53.600 --> 0:09:54.830
Oh...

0:09:55.040 --> 0:09:59.800
My God, you must have one great view
of the Sangre de Cristos.

0:10:00.000 --> 0:10:01.040
Walt,

0:10:01.280 --> 0:10:03.590
what are you doing here?

0:10:05.240 --> 0:10:07.760
I saw you on <i>Charlie Rose.</i>

0:10:08.760 --> 0:10:10.320
You looked great.

0:10:12.160 --> 0:10:15.950
You both did.
If you are here to--

0:10:16.120 --> 0:10:18.110
To hurt us--

0:10:18.320 --> 0:10:21.280
Walt, whatever it is
you're planning--

0:10:21.440 --> 0:10:24.160
Actually, I'm here
to give you something.

0:10:26.600 --> 0:10:28.560
It's out in my car.

0:10:29.080 --> 0:10:33.310
How about the three of us take a walk
to it? It's just parked down the road.

0:10:33.480 --> 0:10:36.040
I couldn't get it past your gate.

0:10:43.680 --> 0:10:47.640
Elliott, if we're gonna go that way,

0:10:47.800 --> 0:10:50.320
you'll need a bigger knife.

0:11:00.720 --> 0:11:02.920
Keep stacking. It'll all fit.

0:11:09.960 --> 0:11:12.270
That's all right.

0:11:12.480 --> 0:11:15.710
Yeah, just throw it on top.

0:11:18.280 --> 0:11:22.240
Gretchen, would you mind? We don't
want to lose any under the furniture.

0:11:25.520 --> 0:11:27.110
All right.

0:11:28.080 --> 0:11:32.310
That is $9,720,000.

0:11:32.480 --> 0:11:36.080
Where did it come from?
And why is it here?

0:11:36.960 --> 0:11:39.870
I earned it, and you're going to
give it to my children.

0:11:40.040 --> 0:11:41.950
What? Why?
Walt, I don't think we--

0:11:42.120 --> 0:11:44.030
On my son's 18th birthday,

0:11:44.200 --> 0:11:47.990
which is 10 months
and two days from today,

0:11:48.160 --> 0:11:50.150
you will give him this money,

0:11:50.320 --> 0:11:52.440
in the form of an irrevocable trust.

0:11:52.600 --> 0:11:57.470
You will tell him that it is his
to do with as he sees fit,

0:11:57.640 --> 0:12:02.510
but with the hope that he uses it
for his college education.

0:12:02.680 --> 0:12:07.910
And for the betterment of his family.
Walt, I'm not sure that we follow.

0:12:08.120 --> 0:12:09.790
Why...?

0:12:09.960 --> 0:12:12.320
I mean, why, in particular,
would we--?

0:12:12.480 --> 0:12:15.630
If you wanna give your kids
drug money, go do it yourself.

0:12:15.800 --> 0:12:17.150
I can't.

0:12:17.320 --> 0:12:19.550
My wife and son hate me.

0:12:19.720 --> 0:12:22.280
They won't take my money.

0:12:22.440 --> 0:12:23.950
Even if they did,

0:12:24.120 --> 0:12:27.110
the federal government
wouldn't let them.

0:12:28.680 --> 0:12:33.280
But two rich benefactors who are known
for their charitable endeavors,

0:12:33.480 --> 0:12:37.600
who would think nothing of,
for instance, writing a $28 million check,

0:12:37.760 --> 0:12:41.390
to help victims
of methamphetamine abuse?

0:12:41.560 --> 0:12:44.790
I have to think that your money
would be very welcome.

0:12:44.960 --> 0:12:47.240
It wouldn't make any sense
coming from us.

0:12:47.400 --> 0:12:49.120
It certainly would.

0:12:49.280 --> 0:12:53.800
My children are blameless victims
of their monstrous father.

0:12:54.000 --> 0:12:56.520
A man who you once knew
quite well.

0:13:02.800 --> 0:13:05.160
Call it a beau geste,
call it liberal guilt,

0:13:05.320 --> 0:13:07.550
call it whatever you want, but do it.

0:13:08.520 --> 0:13:15.120
And you are not to spend
a single dime of your own money.

0:13:15.280 --> 0:13:21.440
If there are taxes or lawyers' fees owed,
you will take it right from here.

0:13:21.600 --> 0:13:24.120
They use my money, never yours.

0:13:24.320 --> 0:13:25.960
Okay, Walt, sure.

0:13:26.120 --> 0:13:29.000
That sounds reasonable.

0:13:30.640 --> 0:13:32.360
So, what happens next?

0:13:33.200 --> 0:13:37.910
I guess we shake on it,
and I leave.

0:14:07.440 --> 0:14:09.880
I can trust you to do this.

0:14:10.040 --> 0:14:11.390
Yes.

0:14:11.560 --> 0:14:14.550
Absolutely, you can.

0:14:30.640 --> 0:14:33.310
Don't move. Don't--
Don't dare move a muscle.

0:14:33.480 --> 0:14:37.920
You don't want them to think that
you're trying to get away. Just breathe.

0:14:40.200 --> 0:14:43.190
Just this afternoon,
I had an extra $200,000

0:14:43.400 --> 0:14:47.080
that I would have loved dearly
to leave on top of this table.

0:14:48.600 --> 0:14:55.360
Instead, I gave it to the two best
hit men west of the Mississippi.

0:14:55.520 --> 0:14:57.640
Now,

0:14:57.800 --> 0:15:01.680
whatever happens to me tomorrow,

0:15:03.120 --> 0:15:05.350
they'll still be out there.

0:15:07.040 --> 0:15:09.080
Keeping tabs.

0:15:09.800 --> 0:15:10.840
And if,

0:15:11.120 --> 0:15:13.270
for any reason,

0:15:13.440 --> 0:15:17.400
that my children
do not get this money,

0:15:17.600 --> 0:15:22.070
a kind of countdown
will begin.

0:15:22.240 --> 0:15:25.870
Maybe a day or so later,
maybe a week, a year,

0:15:26.040 --> 0:15:30.830
when you're going for a walk in Santa
Fe or Manhattan or Prague, wherever,

0:15:31.000 --> 0:15:36.600
and you're talking
about your stock prices

0:15:38.440 --> 0:15:41.670
without a worry in the world.

0:15:42.680 --> 0:15:44.990
And then suddenly,

0:15:45.160 --> 0:15:48.310
you'll hear the scrape
of a footstep behind you,

0:15:48.480 --> 0:15:50.520
but before you can
even turn around:

0:15:50.760 --> 0:15:51.800
Pop!

0:15:57.640 --> 0:15:59.630
Darkness.

0:16:05.680 --> 0:16:08.750
Cheer up, beautiful people.

0:16:10.560 --> 0:16:13.360
This is where you get to make it right.

0:17:01.480 --> 0:17:03.120
Oh, yeah, right.

0:17:11.560 --> 0:17:14.550
You know, I don't exactly know
how to feel about all this.

0:17:14.760 --> 0:17:15.880
For real, yo.

0:17:16.040 --> 0:17:20.160
Whole thing felt kind of shady,
you know, like, morality-wise?

0:17:20.320 --> 0:17:22.310
Totally.

0:17:23.840 --> 0:17:25.990
How do you feel now?

0:17:27.720 --> 0:17:30.710
Better.
Yeah, definitely improving.

0:17:31.720 --> 0:17:33.070
What's this I hear

0:17:33.320 --> 0:17:35.440
about blue meth
still being out there?

0:17:36.640 --> 0:17:37.680
What do you mean?

0:17:37.880 --> 0:17:39.600
Have you heard anything?

0:17:39.760 --> 0:17:42.070
Is it still being sold?

0:17:44.280 --> 0:17:45.840
Yeah.

0:17:50.960 --> 0:17:52.310
By whom?

0:17:53.280 --> 0:17:54.840
It's you, right?

0:17:55.840 --> 0:17:57.590
I mean, aren't you
still cooking?

0:18:01.080 --> 0:18:02.280
Damn, man.

0:18:02.440 --> 0:18:04.000
We were sure it was you,

0:18:04.200 --> 0:18:05.550
because that shit is choice, yo.

0:18:05.720 --> 0:18:06.950
Better than ever.

0:18:07.120 --> 0:18:10.240
I mean, um, you know.

0:18:11.800 --> 0:18:14.080
Jesse.
Seriously?

0:18:14.280 --> 0:18:17.640
You said he moved to Alaska.
That's what I heard.

0:18:17.800 --> 0:18:19.030
Right on, Jesse.

0:18:19.240 --> 0:18:20.750
Passing the torch.

0:18:20.920 --> 0:18:24.630
Damn, man, couldn't he at least
throw a brother a bone?

0:20:06.440 --> 0:20:08.080
Whoa, what happened there?

0:20:10.120 --> 0:20:11.470
It's my birthday.

0:20:11.640 --> 0:20:14.030
Yeah? Well, happy birthday.

0:21:02.280 --> 0:21:07.510
It's easy money. Till we catch you. Say
the word, I'll take you on a ride-along.

0:21:07.680 --> 0:21:10.350
You can watch us
knock down a meth lab.

0:21:10.520 --> 0:21:12.480
Get a little excitement
in your life. Heh, heh.

0:21:13.160 --> 0:21:15.360
Yeah, someday.

0:21:42.520 --> 0:21:45.560
Welcome. Would you like a menu?
No, thank you.

0:21:45.720 --> 0:21:49.270
Chamomile tea with soy milk, please.
All right, you got it.

0:22:04.920 --> 0:22:07.150
Hey, how you doing?

0:22:07.320 --> 0:22:08.910
Good.

0:22:09.080 --> 0:22:11.390
How's things?

0:22:11.600 --> 0:22:13.110
Hey, I like your...

0:22:15.520 --> 0:22:16.840
Shirt.

0:22:17.000 --> 0:22:19.830
My blouse?
Nice. Yeah, I like the color.

0:22:20.000 --> 0:22:22.830
That's a nice color on you.

0:22:23.000 --> 0:22:24.510
It's kind of a--

0:22:24.680 --> 0:22:29.440
I don't know exactly what you'd call it.
It's kind of a cornflower blue.

0:22:29.600 --> 0:22:32.990
Before you say or do anything,
just hear me out.

0:22:34.480 --> 0:22:36.360
Todd.
Nobody knows that I'm here.

0:22:36.520 --> 0:22:40.880
Just listen for two minutes,
and then I'll leave. Please.

0:22:41.080 --> 0:22:42.560
No. Please.

0:22:42.720 --> 0:22:46.160
Just two minutes of your time.
That's all I ask.

0:22:48.280 --> 0:22:49.320
Please.

0:22:55.640 --> 0:22:58.110
You're running out of
methylamine, aren't you?

0:22:58.280 --> 0:23:00.480
I can do the math.

0:23:00.640 --> 0:23:04.110
You've been at it long enough.
You must be running low.

0:23:05.120 --> 0:23:08.000
I have a new method

0:23:08.160 --> 0:23:10.120
that requires no methylamine.

0:23:10.320 --> 0:23:14.870
It's easy, and it will keep you in business.
And, Todd, I could teach it to you.

0:23:15.080 --> 0:23:17.640
How did you know
to find us here?

0:23:18.320 --> 0:23:19.800
Ten a.m.

0:23:20.000 --> 0:23:23.150
Every Tuesday morning,
you and I met here.

0:23:23.320 --> 0:23:26.840
You're rather
schedule-oriented, I guess.

0:23:41.120 --> 0:23:42.550
Sorry.

0:23:49.560 --> 0:23:51.360
I need the money.

0:23:52.400 --> 0:23:55.950
I've spent almost all of mine already,

0:23:56.160 --> 0:24:00.150
just trying to stay
one step ahead of the police.

0:24:00.320 --> 0:24:03.040
Mr. White, I don't think there's--

0:24:03.200 --> 0:24:06.190
How much would it cost us?

0:24:08.000 --> 0:24:09.750
Nothing short of a million.

0:24:09.920 --> 0:24:12.070
And believe me, for this,

0:24:12.280 --> 0:24:14.190
that is giving it away.

0:24:15.200 --> 0:24:16.920
I think Jack should hear this.

0:24:17.080 --> 0:24:18.400
Yeah, I don't know.

0:24:18.600 --> 0:24:24.710
Now, listen, I can come up
there tonight and talk to him.

0:24:24.880 --> 0:24:26.630
He'd get it.

0:24:26.800 --> 0:24:29.790
This is a win-win situation.

0:24:30.400 --> 0:24:33.280
Hi, what can I get for you two?
He's just leaving.

0:24:33.440 --> 0:24:36.160
Good seeing you again.
Take care.

0:24:39.760 --> 0:24:41.270
For you?

0:24:41.440 --> 0:24:42.510
I'm good.

0:24:42.680 --> 0:24:44.910
And I need more stevia.

0:24:54.720 --> 0:24:57.870
Okay, no disrespect to the man,
but doing business with him?

0:24:58.040 --> 0:24:59.080
Right now, that's not--

0:24:59.240 --> 0:25:02.040
Of course we're not
doing business with him.

0:25:03.560 --> 0:25:05.150
Todd, please.

0:25:05.320 --> 0:25:07.520
Don't make me walk you through this.

0:25:11.600 --> 0:25:14.590
Jesus. Did you look at him?

0:25:16.400 --> 0:25:18.550
You'd be doing him a favor.

0:27:04.600 --> 0:27:07.960
<i>Hello, please record after the tone.</i>

0:27:09.480 --> 0:27:11.200
<i>Truce, all right?</i>

0:27:11.400 --> 0:27:14.470
<i>Skyler, I have news about Walt,
and you need to hear it,</i>

0:27:14.640 --> 0:27:16.760
<i>so if you're there, pick up.</i>

0:27:17.920 --> 0:27:19.480
<i>Skyler--</i>

0:27:20.480 --> 0:27:22.280
Hey.

0:27:22.960 --> 0:27:24.710
What's up?

0:27:24.880 --> 0:27:26.630
<i>Walt's in town.</i>

0:27:27.320 --> 0:27:28.360
Yeah?

0:27:28.520 --> 0:27:31.120
That car they thought he stole
in New Hampshire,

0:27:31.280 --> 0:27:34.480
they found it in a Denny's
parking lot right on Central.

0:27:34.640 --> 0:27:38.110
<i>And your next-door neighbor,
on the right-- What's her name, Becky?</i>

0:27:38.280 --> 0:27:41.830
Becky's on the left. Carol's on the right.
<i>Becky, Carol, whatever.</i>

0:27:42.000 --> 0:27:44.470
<i>She saw him at your old house.</i>

0:27:44.680 --> 0:27:46.830
Just this morning, plain as day.

0:27:47.000 --> 0:27:51.550
He's there, walking out of your house,
and he calls her by name.

0:27:51.720 --> 0:27:56.110
He didn't hurt her, did he? He didn't--?
No, he's just like, "Hey, Becky!"

0:27:56.320 --> 0:27:59.040
Or Carol, whatever.

0:27:59.200 --> 0:28:01.640
<i>She said he looked exactly
like the Unabomber.</i>

0:28:01.800 --> 0:28:05.560
But she's positive it was him.
They're getting calls from all over town.

0:28:05.720 --> 0:28:08.680
He's here, he's there,
he's going to blow up city hall.

0:28:08.840 --> 0:28:11.880
He has some sort of manifesto.
He wants to be on the news.

0:28:12.080 --> 0:28:15.550
Who's making these calls? Him?
<i>There are two or three voices.</i>

0:28:15.720 --> 0:28:19.400
<i>They're not sure if they're crank calls
or people he's put up to it,</i>

0:28:19.560 --> 0:28:21.600
<i>or if they're actual anonymous tips.</i>

0:28:21.800 --> 0:28:24.630
<i>It's stretching them thin,
which is maybe the point.</i>

0:28:24.800 --> 0:28:26.150
<i>As far as I'm concerned,</i>

0:28:26.320 --> 0:28:30.230
there are three places that he would go:
To you, to me, or Flynn.

0:28:30.400 --> 0:28:31.960
<i>Right.</i>

0:28:32.120 --> 0:28:33.870
They're watching the high school.

0:28:34.040 --> 0:28:37.270
They're probably watching
your place too.

0:28:37.480 --> 0:28:38.990
I mean,

0:28:39.800 --> 0:28:42.270
I know that's what Hank would do.

0:28:42.440 --> 0:28:47.150
There is no way Walt's getting to you.
They are absolutely going to catch him.

0:28:47.320 --> 0:28:48.440
No doubt about it.

0:28:48.600 --> 0:28:52.440
That arrogant asshole thinks he's some
criminal mastermind, but he's not.

0:28:53.120 --> 0:28:55.030
<i>But on the off chance...</i>

0:28:55.200 --> 0:28:57.110
Yeah.

0:28:57.280 --> 0:29:01.070
On the million-to-one chance,

0:29:02.280 --> 0:29:03.950
you be on the lookout, okay?

0:29:08.440 --> 0:29:10.030
Thanks.

0:29:12.920 --> 0:29:14.800
You got it.

0:29:33.200 --> 0:29:35.270
Five minutes.

0:29:42.280 --> 0:29:44.030
Five minutes.

0:29:50.040 --> 0:29:53.670
You didn't kill anybody
sneaking in here, did you?

0:29:55.360 --> 0:29:58.080
You didn't hurt anybody?
No.

0:29:58.680 --> 0:30:00.190
Didn't have to.

0:30:12.520 --> 0:30:13.950
You look terrible.

0:30:15.400 --> 0:30:17.070
Yeah.

0:30:18.520 --> 0:30:20.030
But I feel good.

0:30:21.920 --> 0:30:23.910
So talk.

0:30:26.360 --> 0:30:27.870
Why are you here?

0:30:38.560 --> 0:30:40.310
It's over.

0:30:41.760 --> 0:30:45.070
And I needed
a proper goodbye.

0:30:46.080 --> 0:30:48.310
Not our last phone call.

0:30:49.880 --> 0:30:52.680
So you're going to the police?

0:30:54.880 --> 0:30:56.630
They'll be coming to me.

0:30:56.800 --> 0:30:59.240
If you're in custody,

0:31:01.320 --> 0:31:04.200
what stops those people
from coming back?

0:31:04.360 --> 0:31:05.920
When--

0:31:06.080 --> 0:31:09.520
When I still had the house,

0:31:09.720 --> 0:31:12.240
three men came
in the middle of the night,

0:31:12.400 --> 0:31:15.150
wearing masks, threatening
Holly and Flynn and me.

0:31:15.320 --> 0:31:18.520
They told me not to talk about
that woman at the car wash,

0:31:18.680 --> 0:31:20.480
and if you're in custody--

0:31:20.640 --> 0:31:23.600
They're not coming back.
Not after tonight.

0:31:24.600 --> 0:31:26.430
What's tonight?

0:31:32.480 --> 0:31:35.470
We don't want your money, Walt.

0:31:36.840 --> 0:31:39.120
I thought Flynn made that clear.

0:31:39.280 --> 0:31:40.950
He did.

0:31:41.480 --> 0:31:44.120
And I don't have any to give you.

0:31:44.720 --> 0:31:47.390
I spent the last of it getting here.

0:31:49.120 --> 0:31:51.920
All I have to give you

0:31:52.760 --> 0:31:54.430
is this.

0:32:05.720 --> 0:32:07.870
Call the DEA once I leave.

0:32:08.040 --> 0:32:12.240
Tell them I was here.
That I forced my way in.

0:32:12.400 --> 0:32:13.990
Tell them...

0:32:16.920 --> 0:32:21.040
Tell them I wanted
bacon and eggs on my birthday,

0:32:22.040 --> 0:32:24.400
and that I gave you that ticket.

0:32:25.520 --> 0:32:27.990
Those numbers
are GPS coordinates.

0:32:29.480 --> 0:32:31.630
For what?

0:32:34.320 --> 0:32:36.520
A burial site.

0:32:37.400 --> 0:32:40.680
That's where they'll
find Hank and Steve Gomez.

0:32:44.160 --> 0:32:46.800
It's where I buried our money.

0:32:47.800 --> 0:32:50.360
And the men who stole it from us,

0:32:50.520 --> 0:32:52.720
the men who still have it,

0:32:53.480 --> 0:32:55.710
they murdered Hank and Steve

0:32:55.880 --> 0:32:58.950
and put them in that hole.

0:33:00.400 --> 0:33:02.550
Now, you trade that

0:33:02.720 --> 0:33:05.160
for a deal with the prosecutor.

0:33:05.320 --> 0:33:07.990
You get yourself out of this.

0:33:08.160 --> 0:33:10.070
Skyler.

0:33:12.760 --> 0:33:14.510
Skyler.

0:33:17.560 --> 0:33:20.200
All the things that I did,

0:33:21.400 --> 0:33:25.080
you need to understand--
If I have to hear

0:33:25.240 --> 0:33:27.440
one more time

0:33:27.600 --> 0:33:30.560
that you did this for the family--

0:33:30.720 --> 0:33:32.840
I did it for me.

0:33:39.480 --> 0:33:41.440
I liked it.

0:33:44.360 --> 0:33:46.960
I was good at it.

0:33:48.640 --> 0:33:50.280
And

0:33:51.200 --> 0:33:52.790
I was

0:33:53.800 --> 0:33:55.600
really...

0:34:00.520 --> 0:34:02.670
I was alive.

0:34:41.680 --> 0:34:44.640
Flynn will be home soon.

0:34:46.080 --> 0:34:48.070
Before I go,

0:34:50.600 --> 0:34:52.750
may I see her?

0:37:32.440 --> 0:37:34.080
Whoo.

0:37:36.680 --> 0:37:38.880
Damn, man, this thing's a classic.

0:37:39.040 --> 0:37:40.190
What block you got in it?

0:37:40.440 --> 0:37:43.350
The 500 or the 425?

0:37:45.200 --> 0:37:47.160
Couldn't tell you.

0:37:52.040 --> 0:37:53.630
Well...

0:37:54.280 --> 0:37:55.870
Five hundred.

0:37:56.920 --> 0:37:59.040
That's the one you want.

0:37:59.200 --> 0:38:02.430
No replacement for displacement.

0:38:12.640 --> 0:38:14.070
Where to?

0:38:14.240 --> 0:38:15.280
To the clubhouse.

0:38:32.360 --> 0:38:35.640
Go ahead, just park it
right in front over here.

0:38:37.440 --> 0:38:41.880
No, no, no, just straight in, man.
Just-- What are--?

0:38:42.160 --> 0:38:44.720
All right, fine, here, whatever.

0:38:55.720 --> 0:38:58.710
Hey, how you doing?

0:38:59.120 --> 0:39:02.110
Turn around,
put your arms out like this.

0:39:22.920 --> 0:39:25.720
While you're at it,
why don't you lift your shirt up,

0:39:25.920 --> 0:39:27.240
give us a spin?

0:39:28.560 --> 0:39:30.710
Christ, I'm not wearing a wire.

0:39:45.680 --> 0:39:47.190
Okay?

0:39:48.960 --> 0:39:52.840
My wallet and keys?
Yeah, you'll get them back. Just relax.

0:40:04.920 --> 0:40:06.350
Stay here.

0:40:06.520 --> 0:40:08.640
Keep your eyes open.

0:40:10.320 --> 0:40:13.840
Jesus, look at you with
that head of hair. Is that real?

0:40:14.000 --> 0:40:15.400
Yes.

0:40:15.600 --> 0:40:18.830
That's not a wig? Seriously?
No.

0:40:19.000 --> 0:40:21.520
What were you doing before,
shaving it?

0:40:22.480 --> 0:40:23.520
Yes.

0:40:23.680 --> 0:40:26.510
Christ, that is one fine
head of hair.

0:40:26.680 --> 0:40:28.990
I mean, otherwise,
you look like shit, but--

0:40:29.160 --> 0:40:33.630
Hello to you too, Jack.
Now, can we talk business?

0:40:33.800 --> 0:40:35.870
I don't think so, no.

0:40:36.880 --> 0:40:40.110
Did Todd tell you what I'm offering?
Yeah, he told me.

0:40:40.280 --> 0:40:44.190
The thing is
we're not really in the market.

0:40:46.360 --> 0:40:48.590
You're low on methylamine.
What happens then?

0:40:49.320 --> 0:40:50.550
No, we'll get more.

0:40:51.680 --> 0:40:55.070
That Quayle woman's got her own setup.
The heat's off her.

0:40:55.240 --> 0:40:58.550
She can break loose a barrel.
It ain't broke, so why fix it?

0:40:58.720 --> 0:41:01.440
Todd, please, would you
explain things to your uncle?

0:41:01.640 --> 0:41:04.160
Explain to him the benefit
of what I'm offering.

0:41:05.800 --> 0:41:08.870
You really shouldn't
have come back, Mr. White.

0:41:10.840 --> 0:41:12.830
I'm sorry.

0:41:15.480 --> 0:41:17.790
Wait. Jack.
Where do you want it?

0:41:17.960 --> 0:41:20.320
I don't know,
anywhere but my living room?

0:41:20.480 --> 0:41:23.150
Take him out back.
Jack, look, you owe me.

0:41:23.320 --> 0:41:24.720
You owe me.
Hey, hey, hey.

0:41:24.880 --> 0:41:26.470
Let's go.
I owe you, what for?

0:41:26.640 --> 0:41:30.030
Jesse Pinkman. You promised
you would kill him, and you didn't.

0:41:30.200 --> 0:41:32.510
Instead, you partnered with him.
All right.

0:41:32.680 --> 0:41:34.800
You're his partner now--
Whoa, stop.

0:41:42.760 --> 0:41:44.800
Partners? What are you
talking about?

0:41:44.960 --> 0:41:46.440
He's alive, isn't he?

0:41:46.600 --> 0:41:48.590
He's cooking for you.

0:41:48.760 --> 0:41:50.430
What, are you gonna lie?

0:41:51.480 --> 0:41:54.390
Him being alive
is not him and me being partners.

0:41:54.560 --> 0:41:56.310
Not by a damn sight.

0:41:56.480 --> 0:41:59.230
What, you think
I'd partner with a rat?

0:41:59.400 --> 0:42:00.800
Where is that little piece of shit?

0:42:01.080 --> 0:42:02.480
He's finishing up a batch.

0:42:02.640 --> 0:42:04.280
Go get him. Bring him here.

0:42:06.200 --> 0:42:07.550
Uncle Jack--
No. No, no, no.

0:42:07.720 --> 0:42:10.030
This one here, calling me a liar?

0:42:10.200 --> 0:42:13.110
He just insulted you,
he insulted me, all of us.

0:42:13.280 --> 0:42:17.240
Jesus. Hustle it up. Come on.
Let's get this over with.

0:42:18.520 --> 0:42:21.800
I'm gonna show you
just how wrong you are.

0:42:22.240 --> 0:42:25.360
Then I'm putting that bullet
in your head myself.

0:43:20.600 --> 0:43:23.990
Yeah, you see what I'm
talking about, you son of a bitch?

0:43:28.800 --> 0:43:30.760
Now, does this look
like a partner to you?

0:43:30.960 --> 0:43:32.870
Come here. Take a look.

0:43:33.880 --> 0:43:35.080
Come here!

0:43:46.720 --> 0:43:48.360
Take a look at him.

0:43:48.560 --> 0:43:50.630
Have a gander.

0:43:51.280 --> 0:43:52.920
This is my partner.

0:43:53.080 --> 0:43:55.830
Right, partner? Right, buddy?

0:43:57.440 --> 0:44:00.510
Hardworking, good partner.
Fifty-fifty partner.

0:44:04.280 --> 0:44:05.320
Can you hurry this shit up?

0:44:05.800 --> 0:44:06.840
Make it quick?

0:44:15.760 --> 0:44:18.510
Toddy, get him off, would you?
Yeah, Toddy, get them both off.

0:45:35.640 --> 0:45:37.280
Uncle Jack.

0:45:55.520 --> 0:45:57.480
Jesus.

0:45:58.960 --> 0:46:00.470
Mr. White.

0:47:11.120 --> 0:47:13.430
Wait. Wait.

0:47:21.640 --> 0:47:23.710
You want your money, right?

0:47:25.720 --> 0:47:28.000
You wanna know where it is?

0:47:29.320 --> 0:47:31.680
You pull that trigger, you'll never--

0:48:21.680 --> 0:48:23.190
Do it.

0:48:31.720 --> 0:48:33.920
You want this.

0:48:35.000 --> 0:48:37.310
Say the words.

0:48:38.760 --> 0:48:41.670
Say you want this!

0:48:42.840 --> 0:48:46.520
Nothing happens until I hear you say it.

0:48:48.840 --> 0:48:50.910
I want this.

0:49:13.800 --> 0:49:15.680
Then do it yourself.

0:49:46.600 --> 0:49:48.960
Pick up the phone.

0:49:52.080 --> 0:49:53.750
<i>Hello?</i>

0:49:54.120 --> 0:49:56.190
Is it done?

0:49:56.360 --> 0:49:57.870
Is he gone?

0:49:58.120 --> 0:50:00.110
<i>Yeah, it's done.</i>

0:50:00.480 --> 0:50:02.520
<i>He's gone.</i>

0:50:03.040 --> 0:50:04.270
<i>They're all gone.</i>

0:50:04.480 --> 0:50:07.630
Todd? Who is this?

0:50:08.480 --> 0:50:10.150
It's Walt.

0:50:11.240 --> 0:50:12.910
How are you feeling?

0:50:13.640 --> 0:50:15.870
Kind of under the weather?

0:50:16.040 --> 0:50:18.760
Like you've got the flu?

0:50:18.920 --> 0:50:21.070
That would be
the ricin I gave you.

0:50:21.760 --> 0:50:26.790
<i>I slipped it into that stevia crap
that you're always putting in your tea.</i>

0:50:27.000 --> 0:50:28.800
Oh, my God.

0:50:32.000 --> 0:50:33.800
Well,

0:50:36.000 --> 0:50:38.070
goodbye, Lydia.
