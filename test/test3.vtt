WEBVTT

0:02:07.036 --> 0:02:09.083
Just get me home.

0:02:11.096 --> 0:02:14.011
Just get me home.

0:02:14.032 --> 0:02:16.071
I'll do the rest.

0:05:19.056 --> 0:05:22.071
Yes, hello, this is David Linn from The New York Times.

0:05:22.092 --> 0:05:26.044
May I speak with Susan, please? Thank you.

0:05:30.012 --> 0:05:32.032
Hi, Susan, it's David again.

0:05:32.048 --> 0:05:35.063
I was just calling to see if we can set--

0:05:35.080 --> 0:05:40.000
Well, yes. Well, I figured we'd have to do the interview by phone

0:05:40.016 --> 0:05:42.020
since they've already left New York.

0:05:42.040 --> 0:05:46.008
But what we'd really love to get is a photo of Mr. and Mrs. Schwartz

0:05:46.028 --> 0:05:48.027
to go along with the article.

0:05:48.044 --> 0:05:52.015
When are they scheduled to get home?

0:05:53.064 --> 0:05:58.032
Oh, so they'll be home tonight. Gotcha.

0:05:58.048 --> 0:06:03.051
Now, the address I have on them is Upper Canyon Road. Is that still...?

0:06:03.068 --> 0:06:06.083
No, it isn't. They've-- Oh, let me get a pen.

0:06:07.096 --> 0:06:09.092
Where do they...?

0:06:10.008 --> 0:06:12.099
Tesuque. I see.

0:06:13.016 --> 0:06:14.099
And the address?

0:06:17.032 --> 0:06:21.060
Is that up near the opera house? I hear that's nice.

0:06:22.044 --> 0:06:24.091
Well, I'll be in contact with my photographer

0:06:25.008 --> 0:06:27.012
to check on his schedule.

0:06:27.032 --> 0:06:29.012
No, no, it's their call.

0:06:30.008 --> 0:06:32.096
I know how busy Mr. and Mrs. Schwartz are.

0:06:33.016 --> 0:06:34.051
Thank you.

0:06:34.068 --> 0:06:38.004
This should make one hell of a story.

0:06:38.020 --> 0:06:40.032
Goodbye.

0:06:55.056 --> 0:06:59.019
I'm just saying, it's apples and oranges.

0:07:00.008 --> 0:07:01.083
Listen, I maintain

0:07:02.000 --> 0:07:04.047
if I want pizza

0:07:04.064 --> 0:07:06.044
I go to a pizza place. Yeah.

0:07:06.060 --> 0:07:09.059
If I want Thai, I go to a Thai place.

0:07:09.076 --> 0:07:13.080
What is the point in comparing Did I marry you?

0:07:13.096 --> 0:07:16.024
pizza to Thai? What has happened?

0:07:16.040 --> 0:07:18.052
- This is different. - They're completely--

0:07:18.068 --> 0:07:21.004
Oh, come on, are you the man I married?

0:07:21.020 --> 0:07:25.024
I am the guy who wants to end this ridiculous conversation

0:07:25.040 --> 0:07:28.087
kick off my shoes, and have a very large glass of wine.

0:07:29.004 --> 0:07:33.016
Well, I'm gonna tell you to be my guest.

0:07:34.092 --> 0:07:35.096
All right, wait.

0:07:36.012 --> 0:07:40.016
The answer is 21.

0:07:40.032 --> 0:07:41.083
No. Yes.

0:07:42.000 --> 0:07:44.039
Yes, because it has history.

0:07:44.056 --> 0:07:46.004
Come on.

0:07:46.020 --> 0:07:47.060
Prohibition.

0:07:47.076 --> 0:07:49.019
The Sweet Smell of Success.

0:07:49.040 --> 0:07:51.015
And Per Se has Thomas Keller.

0:07:51.036 --> 0:07:52.059
Game, set, and match.

0:07:52.076 --> 0:07:54.075
The whole vibe is so Yountville.

0:07:54.092 --> 0:07:56.091
You transplant it to Manhattan--

0:07:57.012 --> 0:07:59.068
Transplant it to Islamabad, I would eat there.

0:07:59.084 --> 0:08:01.027
Oh, there's a good thought.

0:08:01.044 --> 0:08:02.048
What, Islamabad?

0:08:02.068 --> 0:08:04.040
No, Napa. We have to go to Napa.

0:08:04.056 --> 0:08:08.000
Oh, my God, all this talk of food. Do you think Juana left us anything?

0:08:10.020 --> 0:08:12.056
She doesn't think we're coming back until Wednesday.

0:08:12.076 --> 0:08:15.036
Unless you told her. No, I haven't talked to her.

0:08:15.052 --> 0:08:17.072
Oh, look, here.

0:08:17.088 --> 0:08:20.040
Just a pear, that'll be perfect. Yeah.

0:08:20.060 --> 0:08:22.083
You wanna get us a nice bottle of wine?

0:08:23.004 --> 0:08:24.011
Mm-hm.

0:08:24.032 --> 0:08:26.031
Do you think we have any of those--?

0:08:26.052 --> 0:08:29.091
What are those crackers with, like, the sun-dried tomato

0:08:30.008 --> 0:08:33.039
and they were slightly peppery, but not too peppery.

0:08:33.056 --> 0:08:36.008
- We don't have them? - No.

0:08:36.092 --> 0:08:37.096
Ask Juana.

0:08:38.020 --> 0:08:39.043
We haven't had them in forever.

0:08:39.060 --> 0:08:43.015
I don't know why she doesn't get those. Why don't you talk to her?

0:08:43.032 --> 0:08:45.052
She's got that thing with her daughter.

0:08:45.068 --> 0:08:47.075
Anyway, Napa? Yeah.

0:08:47.096 --> 0:08:50.016
How long since we've been? Two years.

0:08:50.036 --> 0:08:52.019
Jesus, that's two years.

0:08:52.036 --> 0:08:54.059
Yeah, too long, right? Is this okay?

0:08:54.080 --> 0:08:56.052
Oh, that looks p e r fe c to.

0:08:56.072 --> 0:08:59.068
You wanna get the fireplace?

0:09:00.084 --> 0:09:02.012
Is it good? Mm-hm.

0:09:02.028 --> 0:09:03.092
Is it ripe? Mm-hm.

0:09:04.008 --> 0:09:06.028
Yeah.

0:09:06.048 --> 0:09:09.092
We could invite George and Delores. They could come up from Marin.

0:09:10.008 --> 0:09:12.007
And Bill and Miriam Cohen.

0:09:12.028 --> 0:09:16.004
We could have a little spa action, right?

0:09:16.024 --> 0:09:18.047
And then we could do some sort of wine, and then--

0:09:27.096 --> 0:09:30.003
Hello, Gretchen.

0:09:30.020 --> 0:09:32.019
Elliott.

0:09:33.096 --> 0:09:36.052
I really like your new house.

0:09:38.068 --> 0:09:40.035
Walt.

0:09:42.024 --> 0:09:44.023
This...

0:09:50.072 --> 0:09:52.076
Are we looking east?

0:09:53.060 --> 0:09:54.083
Oh...

0:09:55.004 --> 0:09:59.080
My God, you must have one great view of the Sangre de Cristos.

0:10:00.000 --> 0:10:01.004
Walt

0:10:01.028 --> 0:10:03.059
what are you doing here?

0:10:05.024 --> 0:10:07.076
I saw you on Charlie Rose.

0:10:08.076 --> 0:10:10.032
You looked great.

0:10:12.016 --> 0:10:15.095
You both did. If you are here to--

0:10:16.012 --> 0:10:18.011
To hurt us--

0:10:18.032 --> 0:10:21.028
Walt, whatever it is you're planning--

0:10:21.044 --> 0:10:24.016
Actually, I'm here to give you something.

0:10:26.060 --> 0:10:28.056
It's out in my car.

0:10:29.008 --> 0:10:33.031
How about the three of us take a walk to it? It's just parked down the road.

0:10:33.048 --> 0:10:36.004
I couldn't get it past your gate.

0:10:43.068 --> 0:10:47.064
Elliott, if we're gonna go that way

0:10:47.080 --> 0:10:50.032
you'll need a bigger knife.

0:11:00.072 --> 0:11:02.092
Keep stacking. It'll all fit.

0:11:09.096 --> 0:11:12.027
That's all right.

0:11:12.048 --> 0:11:15.071
Yeah, just throw it on top.

0:11:18.028 --> 0:11:22.024
Gretchen, would you mind? We don't want to lose any under the furniture.

0:11:25.052 --> 0:11:27.011
All right.

0:11:28.008 --> 0:11:32.031
That is $9,720,000.

0:11:32.048 --> 0:11:36.008
Where did it come from? And why is it here?

0:11:36.096 --> 0:11:39.087
I earned it, and you're going to give it to my children.

0:11:40.004 --> 0:11:41.095
What? Why? Walt, I don't think we--

0:11:42.012 --> 0:11:44.003
On my son's 18th birthday

0:11:44.020 --> 0:11:47.099
which is 10 months and two days from today

0:11:48.016 --> 0:11:50.015
you will give him this money

0:11:50.032 --> 0:11:52.044
in the form of an irrevocable trust.

0:11:52.060 --> 0:11:57.047
You will tell him that it is his to do with as he sees fit

0:11:57.064 --> 0:12:02.051
but with the hope that he uses it for his college education.

0:12:02.068 --> 0:12:07.091
And for the betterment of his family. Walt, I'm not sure that we follow.

0:12:08.012 --> 0:12:09.079
Why...?

0:12:09.096 --> 0:12:12.032
I mean, why, in particular, would we--?

0:12:12.048 --> 0:12:15.063
If you wanna give your kids drug money, go do it yourself.

0:12:15.080 --> 0:12:17.015
I can't.

0:12:17.032 --> 0:12:19.055
My wife and son hate me.

0:12:19.072 --> 0:12:22.028
They won't take my money.

0:12:22.044 --> 0:12:23.095
Even if they did

0:12:24.012 --> 0:12:27.011
the federal government wouldn't let them.

0:12:28.068 --> 0:12:33.028
But two rich benefactors who are known for their charitable endeavors

0:12:33.048 --> 0:12:37.060
who would think nothing of, for instance, writing a $28 million check

0:12:37.076 --> 0:12:41.039
to help victims of methamphetamine abuse?

0:12:41.056 --> 0:12:44.079
I have to think that your money would be very welcome.

0:12:44.096 --> 0:12:47.024
It wouldn't make any sense coming from us.

0:12:47.040 --> 0:12:49.012
It certainly would.

0:12:49.028 --> 0:12:53.080
My children are blameless victims of their monstrous father.

0:12:54.000 --> 0:12:56.052
A man who you once knew quite well.

0:13:02.080 --> 0:13:05.016
Call it a beau geste, call it liberal guilt

0:13:05.032 --> 0:13:07.055
call it whatever you want, but do it.

0:13:08.052 --> 0:13:15.012
And you are not to spend a single dime of your own money.

0:13:15.028 --> 0:13:21.044
If there are taxes or lawyers' fees owed, you will take it right from here.

0:13:21.060 --> 0:13:24.012
They use my money, never yours.

0:13:24.032 --> 0:13:25.096
Okay, Walt, sure.

0:13:26.012 --> 0:13:29.000
That sounds reasonable.

0:13:30.064 --> 0:13:32.036
So, what happens next?

0:13:33.020 --> 0:13:37.091
I guess we shake on it, and I leave.

0:14:07.044 --> 0:14:09.088
I can trust you to do this.

0:14:10.004 --> 0:14:11.039
Yes.

0:14:11.056 --> 0:14:14.055
Absolutely, you can.

0:14:30.064 --> 0:14:33.031
Don't move. Don't-- Don't dare move a muscle.

0:14:33.048 --> 0:14:37.092
You don't want them to think that you're trying to get away. Just breathe.

0:14:40.020 --> 0:14:43.019
Just this afternoon, I had an extra $200,000

0:14:43.040 --> 0:14:47.008
that I would have loved dearly to leave on top of this table.

0:14:48.060 --> 0:14:55.036
Instead, I gave it to the two best hit men west of the Mississippi.

0:14:55.052 --> 0:14:57.064
Now

0:14:57.080 --> 0:15:01.068
whatever happens to me tomorrow

0:15:03.012 --> 0:15:05.035
they'll still be out there.

0:15:07.004 --> 0:15:09.008
Keeping tabs.

0:15:09.080 --> 0:15:10.084
And if

0:15:11.012 --> 0:15:13.027
for any reason

0:15:13.044 --> 0:15:17.040
that my children do not get this money

0:15:17.060 --> 0:15:22.007
a kind of countdown will begin.

0:15:22.024 --> 0:15:25.087
Maybe a day or so later, maybe a week, a year

0:15:26.004 --> 0:15:30.083
when you're going for a walk in Santa Fe or Manhattan or Prague, wherever

0:15:31.000 --> 0:15:36.060
and you're talking about your stock prices

0:15:38.044 --> 0:15:41.067
without a worry in the world.

0:15:42.068 --> 0:15:44.099
And then suddenly

0:15:45.016 --> 0:15:48.031
you'll hear the scrape of a footstep behind you

0:15:48.048 --> 0:15:50.052
but before you can even turn around:

0:15:50.076 --> 0:15:51.080
Pop!

0:15:57.064 --> 0:15:59.063
Darkness.

0:16:05.068 --> 0:16:08.075
Cheer up, beautiful people.

0:16:10.056 --> 0:16:13.036
This is where you get to make it right.

0:17:01.048 --> 0:17:03.012
Oh, yeah, right.

0:17:11.056 --> 0:17:14.055
You know, I don't exactly know how to feel about all this.

0:17:14.076 --> 0:17:15.088
For real, yo.

0:17:16.004 --> 0:17:20.016
Whole thing felt kind of shady, you know, like, morality-wise?

0:17:20.032 --> 0:17:22.031
Totally.

0:17:23.084 --> 0:17:25.099
How do you feel now?

0:17:27.072 --> 0:17:30.071
Better. Yeah, definitely improving.

0:17:31.072 --> 0:17:33.007
What's this I hear

0:17:33.032 --> 0:17:35.044
about blue meth still being out there?

0:17:36.064 --> 0:17:37.068
What do you mean?

0:17:37.088 --> 0:17:39.060
Have you heard anything?

0:17:39.076 --> 0:17:42.007
Is it still being sold?

0:17:44.028 --> 0:17:45.084
Yeah.

0:17:50.096 --> 0:17:52.031
By whom?

0:17:53.028 --> 0:17:54.084
It's you, right?

0:17:55.084 --> 0:17:57.059
I mean, aren't you still cooking?

0:18:01.008 --> 0:18:02.028
Damn, man.

0:18:02.044 --> 0:18:04.000
We were sure it was you

0:18:04.020 --> 0:18:05.055
because that shit is choice, yo.

0:18:05.072 --> 0:18:06.095
Better than ever.

0:18:07.012 --> 0:18:10.024
I mean, um, you know.

0:18:11.080 --> 0:18:14.008
Jesse. Seriously?

0:18:14.028 --> 0:18:17.064
You said he moved to Alaska. That's what I heard.

0:18:17.080 --> 0:18:19.003
Right on, Jesse.

0:18:19.024 --> 0:18:20.075
Passing the torch.

0:18:20.092 --> 0:18:24.063
Damn, man, couldn't he at least throw a brother a bone?

0:20:06.044 --> 0:20:08.008
Whoa, what happened there?

0:20:10.012 --> 0:20:11.047
It's my birthday.

0:20:11.064 --> 0:20:14.003
Yeah? Well, happy birthday.

0:21:02.028 --> 0:21:07.051
It's easy money. Till we catch you. Say the word, I'll take you on a ride-along.

0:21:07.068 --> 0:21:10.035
You can watch us knock down a meth lab.

0:21:10.052 --> 0:21:12.048
Get a little excitement in your life. Heh, heh.

0:21:13.016 --> 0:21:15.036
Yeah, someday.

0:21:42.052 --> 0:21:45.056
Welcome. Would you like a menu? No, thank you.

0:21:45.072 --> 0:21:49.027
Chamomile tea with soy milk, please. All right, you got it.

0:22:04.092 --> 0:22:07.015
Hey, how you doing?

0:22:07.032 --> 0:22:08.091
Good.

0:22:09.008 --> 0:22:11.039
How's things?

0:22:11.060 --> 0:22:13.011
Hey, I like your...

0:22:15.052 --> 0:22:16.084
Shirt.

0:22:17.000 --> 0:22:19.083
My blouse? Nice. Yeah, I like the color.

0:22:20.000 --> 0:22:22.083
That's a nice color on you.

0:22:23.000 --> 0:22:24.051
It's kind of a--

0:22:24.068 --> 0:22:29.044
I don't know exactly what you'd call it. It's kind of a cornflower blue.

0:22:29.060 --> 0:22:32.099
Before you say or do anything, just hear me out.

0:22:34.048 --> 0:22:36.036
Todd. Nobody knows that I'm here.

0:22:36.052 --> 0:22:40.088
Just listen for two minutes, and then I'll leave. Please.

0:22:41.008 --> 0:22:42.056
No. Please.

0:22:42.072 --> 0:22:46.016
Just two minutes of your time. That's all I ask.

0:22:48.028 --> 0:22:49.032
Please.

0:22:55.064 --> 0:22:58.011
You're running out of methylamine, aren't you?

0:22:58.028 --> 0:23:00.048
I can do the math.

0:23:00.064 --> 0:23:04.011
You've been at it long enough. You must be running low.

0:23:05.012 --> 0:23:08.000
I have a new method

0:23:08.016 --> 0:23:10.012
that requires no methylamine.

0:23:10.032 --> 0:23:14.087
It's easy, and it will keep you in business. And, Todd, I could teach it to you.

0:23:15.008 --> 0:23:17.064
How did you know to find us here?

0:23:18.032 --> 0:23:19.080
Ten a.m.

0:23:20.000 --> 0:23:23.015
Every Tuesday morning, you and I met here.

0:23:23.032 --> 0:23:26.084
You're rather schedule-oriented, I guess.

0:23:41.012 --> 0:23:42.055
Sorry.

0:23:49.056 --> 0:23:51.036
I need the money.

0:23:52.040 --> 0:23:55.095
I've spent almost all of mine already

0:23:56.016 --> 0:24:00.015
just trying to stay one step ahead of the police.

0:24:00.032 --> 0:24:03.004
Mr. White, I don't think there's--

0:24:03.020 --> 0:24:06.019
How much would it cost us?

0:24:08.000 --> 0:24:09.075
Nothing short of a million.

0:24:09.092 --> 0:24:12.007
And believe me, for this

0:24:12.028 --> 0:24:14.019
that is giving it away.

0:24:15.020 --> 0:24:16.092
I think Jack should hear this.

0:24:17.008 --> 0:24:18.040
Yeah, I don't know.

0:24:18.060 --> 0:24:24.071
Now, listen, I can come up there tonight and talk to him.

0:24:24.088 --> 0:24:26.063
He'd get it.

0:24:26.080 --> 0:24:29.079
This is a win-win situation.

0:24:30.040 --> 0:24:33.028
Hi, what can I get for you two? He's just leaving.

0:24:33.044 --> 0:24:36.016
Good seeing you again. Take care.

0:24:39.076 --> 0:24:41.027
For you?

0:24:41.044 --> 0:24:42.051
I'm good.

0:24:42.068 --> 0:24:44.091
And I need more stevia.

0:24:54.072 --> 0:24:57.087
Okay, no disrespect to the man, but doing business with him?

0:24:58.004 --> 0:24:59.008
Right now, that's not--

0:24:59.024 --> 0:25:02.004
Of course we're not doing business with him.

0:25:03.056 --> 0:25:05.015
Todd, please.

0:25:05.032 --> 0:25:07.052
Don't make me walk you through this.

0:25:11.060 --> 0:25:14.059
Jesus. Did you look at him?

0:25:16.040 --> 0:25:18.055
You'd be doing him a favor.

0:27:04.060 --> 0:27:07.096
Hello, please record after the tone.

0:27:09.048 --> 0:27:11.020
Truce, all right?

0:27:11.040 --> 0:27:14.047
Skyler, I have news about Walt, and you need to hear it,

0:27:14.064 --> 0:27:16.076
so if you're there, pick up.

0:27:17.092 --> 0:27:19.048
Skyler--

0:27:20.048 --> 0:27:22.028
Hey.

0:27:22.096 --> 0:27:24.071
What's up?

0:27:24.088 --> 0:27:26.063
Walt's in town.

0:27:27.032 --> 0:27:28.036
Yeah?

0:27:28.052 --> 0:27:31.012
That car they thought he stole in New Hampshire

0:27:31.028 --> 0:27:34.048
they found it in a Denny's parking lot right on Central.

0:27:34.064 --> 0:27:38.011
And your next-door neighbor, on the right-- What's her name, Becky?

0:27:38.028 --> 0:27:41.083
Becky's on the left. Carol's on the right. Becky, Carol, whatever.

0:27:42.000 --> 0:27:44.047
She saw him at your old house.

0:27:44.068 --> 0:27:46.083
Just this morning, plain as day.

0:27:47.000 --> 0:27:51.055
He's there, walking out of your house, and he calls her by name.

0:27:51.072 --> 0:27:56.011
He didn't hurt her, did he? He didn't--? No, he's just like, "Hey, Becky!"

0:27:56.032 --> 0:27:59.004
Or Carol, whatever.

0:27:59.020 --> 0:28:01.064
She said he looked exactly like the Unabomber.

0:28:01.080 --> 0:28:05.056
But she's positive it was him. They're getting calls from all over town.

0:28:05.072 --> 0:28:08.068
He's here, he's there, he's going to blow up city hall.

0:28:08.084 --> 0:28:11.088
He has some sort of manifesto. He wants to be on the news.

0:28:12.008 --> 0:28:15.055
Who's making these calls? Him? There are two or three voices.

0:28:15.072 --> 0:28:19.040
They're not sure if they're crank calls or people he's put up to it,

0:28:19.056 --> 0:28:21.060
or if they're actual anonymous tips.

0:28:21.080 --> 0:28:24.063
It's stretching them thin, which is maybe the point.

0:28:24.080 --> 0:28:26.015
As far as I'm concerned,

0:28:26.032 --> 0:28:30.023
there are three places that he would go: To you, to me, or Flynn.

0:28:30.040 --> 0:28:31.096
Right.

0:28:32.012 --> 0:28:33.087
They're watching the high school.

0:28:34.004 --> 0:28:37.027
They're probably watching your place too.

0:28:37.048 --> 0:28:38.099
I mean

0:28:39.080 --> 0:28:42.027
I know that's what Hank would do.

0:28:42.044 --> 0:28:47.015
There is no way Walt's getting to you. They are absolutely going to catch him.

0:28:47.032 --> 0:28:48.044
No doubt about it.

0:28:48.060 --> 0:28:52.044
That arrogant asshole thinks he's some criminal mastermind, but he's not.

0:28:53.012 --> 0:28:55.003
But on the off chance...

0:28:55.020 --> 0:28:57.011
Yeah.

0:28:57.028 --> 0:29:01.007
On the million-to-one chance

0:29:02.028 --> 0:29:03.095
you be on the lookout, okay?

0:29:08.044 --> 0:29:10.003
Thanks.

0:29:12.092 --> 0:29:14.080
You got it.

0:29:33.020 --> 0:29:35.027
Five minutes.

0:29:42.028 --> 0:29:44.003
Five minutes.

0:29:50.004 --> 0:29:53.067
You didn't kill anybody sneaking in here, did you?

0:29:55.036 --> 0:29:58.008
You didn't hurt anybody? No.

0:29:58.068 --> 0:30:00.019
Didn't have to.

0:30:12.052 --> 0:30:13.095
You look terrible.

0:30:15.040 --> 0:30:17.007
Yeah.

0:30:18.052 --> 0:30:20.003
But I feel good.

0:30:21.092 --> 0:30:23.091
So talk.

0:30:26.036 --> 0:30:27.087
Why are you here?

0:30:38.056 --> 0:30:40.031
It's over.

0:30:41.076 --> 0:30:45.007
And I needed a proper goodbye.

0:30:46.008 --> 0:30:48.031
Not our last phone call.

0:30:49.088 --> 0:30:52.068
So you're going to the police?

0:30:54.088 --> 0:30:56.063
They'll be coming to me.

0:30:56.080 --> 0:30:59.024
If you're in custody

0:31:01.032 --> 0:31:04.020
what stops those people from coming back?

0:31:04.036 --> 0:31:05.092
When--

0:31:06.008 --> 0:31:09.052
When I still had the house

0:31:09.072 --> 0:31:12.024
three men came in the middle of the night

0:31:12.040 --> 0:31:15.015
wearing masks, threatening Holly and Flynn and me.

0:31:15.032 --> 0:31:18.052
They told me not to talk about that woman at the car wash

0:31:18.068 --> 0:31:20.048
and if you're in custody--

0:31:20.064 --> 0:31:23.060
They're not coming back. Not after tonight.

0:31:24.060 --> 0:31:26.043
What's tonight?

0:31:32.048 --> 0:31:35.047
We don't want your money, Walt.

0:31:36.084 --> 0:31:39.012
I thought Flynn made that clear.

0:31:39.028 --> 0:31:40.095
He did.

0:31:41.048 --> 0:31:44.012
And I don't have any to give you.

0:31:44.072 --> 0:31:47.039
I spent the last of it getting here.

0:31:49.012 --> 0:31:51.092
All I have to give you

0:31:52.076 --> 0:31:54.043
is this.

0:32:05.072 --> 0:32:07.087
Call the DEA once I leave.

0:32:08.004 --> 0:32:12.024
Tell them I was here. That I forced my way in.

0:32:12.040 --> 0:32:13.099
Tell them...

0:32:16.092 --> 0:32:21.004
Tell them I wanted bacon and eggs on my birthday

0:32:22.004 --> 0:32:24.040
and that I gave you that ticket.

0:32:25.052 --> 0:32:27.099
Those numbers are GPS coordinates.

0:32:29.048 --> 0:32:31.063
For what?

0:32:34.032 --> 0:32:36.052
A burial site.

0:32:37.040 --> 0:32:40.068
That's where they'll find Hank and Steve Gomez.

0:32:44.016 --> 0:32:46.080
It's where I buried our money.

0:32:47.080 --> 0:32:50.036
And the men who stole it from us

0:32:50.052 --> 0:32:52.072
the men who still have it

0:32:53.048 --> 0:32:55.071
they murdered Hank and Steve

0:32:55.088 --> 0:32:58.095
and put them in that hole.

0:33:00.040 --> 0:33:02.055
Now, you trade that

0:33:02.072 --> 0:33:05.016
for a deal with the prosecutor.

0:33:05.032 --> 0:33:07.099
You get yourself out of this.

0:33:08.016 --> 0:33:10.007
Skyler.

0:33:12.076 --> 0:33:14.051
Skyler.

0:33:17.056 --> 0:33:20.020
All the things that I did

0:33:21.040 --> 0:33:25.008
you need to understand-- If I have to hear

0:33:25.024 --> 0:33:27.044
one more time

0:33:27.060 --> 0:33:30.056
that you did this for the family--

0:33:30.072 --> 0:33:32.084
I did it for me.

0:33:39.048 --> 0:33:41.044
I liked it.

0:33:44.036 --> 0:33:46.096
I was good at it.

0:33:48.064 --> 0:33:50.028
And

0:33:51.020 --> 0:33:52.079
I was

0:33:53.080 --> 0:33:55.060
really...

0:34:00.052 --> 0:34:02.067
I was alive.

0:34:41.068 --> 0:34:44.064
Flynn will be home soon.

0:34:46.008 --> 0:34:48.007
Before I go

0:34:50.060 --> 0:34:52.075
may I see her?

0:37:32.044 --> 0:37:34.008
Whoo.

0:37:36.068 --> 0:37:38.088
Damn, man, this thing's a classic.

0:37:39.004 --> 0:37:40.019
What block you got in it?

0:37:40.044 --> 0:37:43.035
The 500 or the 425?

0:37:45.020 --> 0:37:47.016
Couldn't tell you.

0:37:52.004 --> 0:37:53.063
Well...

0:37:54.028 --> 0:37:55.087
Five hundred.

0:37:56.092 --> 0:37:59.004
That's the one you want.

0:37:59.020 --> 0:38:02.043
No replacement for displacement.

0:38:12.064 --> 0:38:14.007
Where to?

0:38:14.024 --> 0:38:15.028
To the clubhouse.

0:38:32.036 --> 0:38:35.064
Go ahead, just park it right in front over here.

0:38:37.044 --> 0:38:41.088
No, no, no, just straight in, man. Just-- What are--?

0:38:42.016 --> 0:38:44.072
All right, fine, here, whatever.

0:38:55.072 --> 0:38:58.071
Hey, how you doing?

0:38:59.012 --> 0:39:02.011
Turn around, put your arms out like this.

0:39:22.092 --> 0:39:25.072
While you're at it, why don't you lift your shirt up

0:39:25.092 --> 0:39:27.024
give us a spin?

0:39:28.056 --> 0:39:30.071
Christ, I'm not wearing a wire.

0:39:45.068 --> 0:39:47.019
Okay?

0:39:48.096 --> 0:39:52.084
My wallet and keys? Yeah, you'll get them back. Just relax.

0:40:04.092 --> 0:40:06.035
Stay here.

0:40:06.052 --> 0:40:08.064
Keep your eyes open.

0:40:10.032 --> 0:40:13.084
Jesus, look at you with that head of hair. Is that real?

0:40:14.000 --> 0:40:15.040
Yes.

0:40:15.060 --> 0:40:18.083
That's not a wig? Seriously? No.

0:40:19.000 --> 0:40:21.052
What were you doing before, shaving it?

0:40:22.048 --> 0:40:23.052
Yes.

0:40:23.068 --> 0:40:26.051
Christ, that is one fine head of hair.

0:40:26.068 --> 0:40:28.099
I mean, otherwise, you look like shit, but--

0:40:29.016 --> 0:40:33.063
Hello to you too, Jack. Now, can we talk business?

0:40:33.080 --> 0:40:35.087
I don't think so, no.

0:40:36.088 --> 0:40:40.011
Did Todd tell you what I'm offering? Yeah, he told me.

0:40:40.028 --> 0:40:44.019
The thing is we're not really in the market.

0:40:46.036 --> 0:40:48.059
You're low on methylamine. What happens then?

0:40:49.032 --> 0:40:50.055
No, we'll get more.

0:40:51.068 --> 0:40:55.007
That Quayle woman's got her own setup. The heat's off her.

0:40:55.024 --> 0:40:58.055
She can break loose a barrel. It ain't broke, so why fix it?

0:40:58.072 --> 0:41:01.044
Todd, please, would you explain things to your uncle?

0:41:01.064 --> 0:41:04.016
Explain to him the benefit of what I'm offering.

0:41:05.080 --> 0:41:08.087
You really shouldn't have come back, Mr. White.

0:41:10.084 --> 0:41:12.083
I'm sorry.

0:41:15.048 --> 0:41:17.079
Wait. Jack. Where do you want it?

0:41:17.096 --> 0:41:20.032
I don't know, anywhere but my living room?

0:41:20.048 --> 0:41:23.015
Take him out back. Jack, look, you owe me.

0:41:23.032 --> 0:41:24.072
You owe me. Hey, hey, hey.

0:41:24.088 --> 0:41:26.047
Let's go. I owe you, what for?

0:41:26.064 --> 0:41:30.003
Jesse Pinkman. You promised you would kill him, and you didn't.

0:41:30.020 --> 0:41:32.051
Instead, you partnered with him. All right.

0:41:32.068 --> 0:41:34.080
You're his partner now-- Whoa, stop.

0:41:42.076 --> 0:41:44.080
Partners? What are you talking about?

0:41:44.096 --> 0:41:46.044
He's alive, isn't he?

0:41:46.060 --> 0:41:48.059
He's cooking for you.

0:41:48.076 --> 0:41:50.043
What, are you gonna lie?

0:41:51.048 --> 0:41:54.039
Him being alive is not him and me being partners.

0:41:54.056 --> 0:41:56.031
Not by a damn sight.

0:41:56.048 --> 0:41:59.023
What, you think I'd partner with a rat?

0:41:59.040 --> 0:42:00.080
Where is that little piece of shit?

0:42:01.008 --> 0:42:02.048
He's finishing up a batch.

0:42:02.064 --> 0:42:04.028
Go get him. Bring him here.

0:42:06.020 --> 0:42:07.055
Uncle Jack-- No. No, no, no.

0:42:07.072 --> 0:42:10.003
This one here, calling me a liar?

0:42:10.020 --> 0:42:13.011
He just insulted you, he insulted me, all of us.

0:42:13.028 --> 0:42:17.024
Jesus. Hustle it up. Come on. Let's get this over with.

0:42:18.052 --> 0:42:21.080
I'm gonna show you just how wrong you are.

0:42:22.024 --> 0:42:25.036
Then I'm putting that bullet in your head myself.

0:43:20.060 --> 0:43:23.099
Yeah, you see what I'm talking about, you son of a bitch?

0:43:28.080 --> 0:43:30.076
Now, does this look like a partner to you?

0:43:30.096 --> 0:43:32.087
Come here. Take a look.

0:43:33.088 --> 0:43:35.008
Come here!

0:43:46.072 --> 0:43:48.036
Take a look at him.

0:43:48.056 --> 0:43:50.063
Have a gander.

0:43:51.028 --> 0:43:52.092
This is my partner.

0:43:53.008 --> 0:43:55.083
Right, partner? Right, buddy?

0:43:57.044 --> 0:44:00.051
Hardworking, good partner. Fifty-fifty partner.

0:44:04.028 --> 0:44:05.032
Can you hurry this shit up?

0:44:05.080 --> 0:44:06.084
Make it quick?

0:44:15.076 --> 0:44:18.051
Toddy, get him off, would you? Yeah, Toddy, get them both off.

0:45:35.064 --> 0:45:37.028
Uncle Jack.

0:45:55.052 --> 0:45:57.048
Jesus.

0:45:58.096 --> 0:46:00.047
Mr. White.

0:47:11.012 --> 0:47:13.043
Wait. Wait.

0:47:21.064 --> 0:47:23.071
You want your money, right?

0:47:25.072 --> 0:47:28.000
You wanna know where it is?

0:47:29.032 --> 0:47:31.068
You pull that trigger, you'll never--

0:48:21.068 --> 0:48:23.019
Do it.

0:48:31.072 --> 0:48:33.092
You want this.

0:48:35.000 --> 0:48:37.031
Say the words.

0:48:38.076 --> 0:48:41.067
Say you want this!

0:48:42.084 --> 0:48:46.052
Nothing happens until I hear you say it.

0:48:48.084 --> 0:48:50.091
I want this.

0:49:13.080 --> 0:49:15.068
Then do it yourself.

0:49:46.060 --> 0:49:48.096
Pick up the phone.

0:49:52.008 --> 0:49:53.075
Hello?

0:49:54.012 --> 0:49:56.019
Is it done?

0:49:56.036 --> 0:49:57.087
Is he gone?

0:49:58.012 --> 0:50:00.011
Yeah, it's done.

0:50:00.048 --> 0:50:02.052
He's gone.

0:50:03.004 --> 0:50:04.027
They're all gone.

0:50:04.048 --> 0:50:07.063
Todd? Who is this?

0:50:08.048 --> 0:50:10.015
It's Walt.

0:50:11.024 --> 0:50:12.091
How are you feeling?

0:50:13.064 --> 0:50:15.087
Kind of under the weather?

0:50:16.004 --> 0:50:18.076
Like you've got the flu?

0:50:18.092 --> 0:50:21.007
That would be the ricin I gave you.

0:50:21.076 --> 0:50:26.079
I slipped it into that stevia crap that you're always putting in your tea.

0:50:27.000 --> 0:50:28.080
Oh, my God.

0:50:32.000 --> 0:50:33.080
Well

0:50:36.000 --> 0:50:38.007
goodbye, Lydia.
