WEBVTT

0:00:30.900 --> 0:00:32.068
That's it.

0:00:33.903 --> 0:00:36.698
Can I just, you know,
look at it for a minute?

0:00:38.158 --> 0:00:39.701
You're an artist, Sid.

0:00:42.120 --> 0:00:44.122
You're telling me
you're just gonna walk out of here

0:00:44.205 --> 0:00:46.166
and I'm never going
to see it again?

0:00:46.249 --> 0:00:47.792
There's a good chance
of that, yes.

0:00:49.210 --> 0:00:50.879
Most guys, you know,
for the first one,

0:00:50.962 --> 0:00:52.589
they start
with something small.

0:00:52.672 --> 0:00:55.258
"Mom," girlfriend's initials,
something like that.

0:00:55.925 --> 0:00:58.219
Not you.

0:00:58.303 --> 0:01:01.514
You get a full set of sleeves,
all in a couple of months.

0:01:01.598 --> 0:01:03.933
Takes guys a few years
to get the ink you got.

0:01:05.310 --> 0:01:07.062
I don't have
a few years.

0:01:08.646 --> 0:01:10.398
Wish to hell I did.

0:02:04.536 --> 0:02:05.829
The vault. Open it.

0:02:05.912 --> 0:02:07.997
We can't. The branch
manager's not here.

0:02:10.208 --> 0:02:11.876
-Where is he?
-It's lunchtime.

0:02:11.960 --> 0:02:13.044
He's at White Castle.

0:02:13.461 --> 0:02:14.337
White Castle?

0:02:14.420 --> 0:02:15.463
It's a fast food restaurant.

0:02:15.547 --> 0:02:18.508
They serve
those little square burgers.

0:02:19.050 --> 0:02:20.301
I know what it is.

0:02:22.762 --> 0:02:24.055
I'm not playing games.

0:02:24.430 --> 0:02:25.557
Open it.

0:02:25.640 --> 0:02:27.809
Sir, you have a half
a million dollars cash in your bag.

0:02:27.892 --> 0:02:29.727
Don't you think
it would be better...

0:02:40.572 --> 0:02:42.240
This is the police.

0:02:42.323 --> 0:02:44.659
You are completely surrounded.

0:02:46.911 --> 0:02:48.246
Put down your weapon.

0:02:50.665 --> 0:02:52.667
Put down your weapons now.

0:02:57.046 --> 0:02:58.840
Rarely in the case
of armed robbery

0:02:58.923 --> 0:03:00.925
do we hear a plea
of no contest.

0:03:01.009 --> 0:03:03.052
Are you sure about this,
Mr. Scofield?

0:03:03.136 --> 0:03:04.637
I'm sure, Your Honor.

0:03:04.721 --> 0:03:06.848
Your Honor, we'd like
to recess if we could.

0:03:06.931 --> 0:03:08.766
My client's a bit confused
at the moment.

0:03:08.850 --> 0:03:09.684
I'm not, Your Honor.

0:03:09.767 --> 0:03:11.060
He is, Your Honor.

0:03:11.144 --> 0:03:13.563
Perhaps you should heed
your representation's advice,

0:03:13.646 --> 0:03:16.274
take some additional time
to consider your response.

0:03:16.357 --> 0:03:17.650
I've already done that,
Your Honor.

0:03:24.199 --> 0:03:26.868
I'll retire to my chambers
to determine sentencing.

0:03:26.951 --> 0:03:28.786
Court's recessed until 1:30.

0:03:31.122 --> 0:03:32.040
Come on, let's go.

0:03:32.123 --> 0:03:33.166
Uncle Mike?

0:03:35.627 --> 0:03:37.003
I didn't want you to come.

0:03:37.629 --> 0:03:39.297
Go home, LJ.

0:03:39.589 --> 0:03:41.299
I didn't want you
to see this.

0:03:48.890 --> 0:03:50.058
He's not gonna
take this well.

0:03:50.141 --> 0:03:52.018
Can you blame him?
He's your nephew.

0:03:52.101 --> 0:03:53.102
He's beginning
to get the idea

0:03:53.186 --> 0:03:54.729
that anybody
he attaches himself to

0:03:54.812 --> 0:03:56.648
is gonna
end up in prison...

0:03:56.731 --> 0:03:57.649
And he's not the only one

0:03:57.732 --> 0:03:59.108
who's starting to feel
that way, Michael.

0:04:00.985 --> 0:04:02.403
Will you give us a minute?

0:04:02.487 --> 0:04:03.446
One minute.

0:04:04.155 --> 0:04:05.782
Don't you understand?

0:04:05.865 --> 0:04:07.367
You just put the book
in that woman's hand

0:04:07.450 --> 0:04:09.577
and she's gonna lob it
at you like a grenade.

0:04:09.661 --> 0:04:12.121
Justice and punishment
are the same thing to her.

0:04:12.413 --> 0:04:13.539
I know.

0:04:13.623 --> 0:04:15.917
Then will you please tell me
what's going through your head?

0:04:16.000 --> 0:04:17.043
We've been over this.

0:04:17.126 --> 0:04:18.419
I've known you
my entire life.

0:04:18.503 --> 0:04:20.838
You don't have
a violent bone in your body,

0:04:20.922 --> 0:04:22.799
and I know you didn't
need the money.

0:04:22.882 --> 0:04:23.758
Veronica.

0:04:23.841 --> 0:04:25.760
Why won't you
let me help you?

0:04:25.843 --> 0:04:27.053
You've been good to me.

0:04:27.136 --> 0:04:28.763
My whole life, you have.

0:04:29.931 --> 0:04:31.349
But you've gotta let me
deal with this.

0:04:31.683 --> 0:04:33.434
Okay?

0:04:33.977 --> 0:04:35.770
Given your lack
of prior criminal conduct,

0:04:36.396 --> 0:04:38.940
I am inclined
toward probation.

0:04:39.023 --> 0:04:41.150
However, the fact that
you discharged a deadly weapon

0:04:41.234 --> 0:04:44.112
during the commission
of the crime suggests malice to me.

0:04:44.195 --> 0:04:46.364
For that reason,
I find it incumbent

0:04:46.447 --> 0:04:49.242
that you see the inside
of a prison cell, Mr. Scofield.

0:04:50.368 --> 0:04:52.954
It says here
that you've requested to be incarcerated

0:04:53.037 --> 0:04:55.123
somewhere near your home
here in Chicago.

0:04:55.206 --> 0:04:56.791
I'm willing to honor that.

0:04:56.874 --> 0:04:58.376
The closest
level one facility to--

0:04:58.459 --> 0:04:59.294
Level one?

0:04:59.377 --> 0:05:01.254
That's maximum security,
Your Honor.

0:05:01.337 --> 0:05:04.590
I would ask counsel to refrain
from interrupting me.

0:05:04.674 --> 0:05:05.633
As I was saying,

0:05:05.717 --> 0:05:07.135
the closest
level one facility

0:05:07.218 --> 0:05:09.220
would be Fox River
State Penitentiary.

0:05:09.304 --> 0:05:10.888
As for the term
of your sentence,

0:05:10.972 --> 0:05:12.473
I'm setting it
at five years.

0:05:12.557 --> 0:05:14.976
You'll be eligible for parole
in half that time.

0:05:15.059 --> 0:05:17.437
Sentence to be carried out immediately.

0:05:30.575 --> 0:05:33.119
Okay, step inside the door
and check yourself for bugs.

0:05:33.202 --> 0:05:34.662
When you hear
the knock, step out.

0:05:34.746 --> 0:05:36.039
Keep the line moving.

0:05:36.122 --> 0:05:38.166
We ain't got all day
to get this done.

0:05:38.249 --> 0:05:39.667
- Let's go. Move it.
- No more talking in line.

0:05:39.751 --> 0:05:41.794
Move it. You got less
than five minutes to take a shower.

0:05:41.878 --> 0:05:43.421
Keep the line moving.
Keep it moving.

0:05:43.504 --> 0:05:46.049
- Move it. Right now. Let's go. Move, move.
- Next!

0:05:49.218 --> 0:05:50.553
Name and back number.

0:05:50.636 --> 0:05:51.888
Scofield, Michael.

0:05:51.971 --> 0:05:52.930
94941.

0:05:53.014 --> 0:05:54.557
Are you
a religious man, Scofield?

0:05:54.640 --> 0:05:55.641
Never really
thought about it.

0:05:55.725 --> 0:05:56.726
Good, 'cause
the Ten Commandments

0:05:56.809 --> 0:05:57.935
don't mean
a box of piss in here.

0:05:58.019 --> 0:05:59.145
We got two commandments
and two only.

0:05:59.228 --> 0:06:01.898
The first commandment
is you got nothing coming.

0:06:01.981 --> 0:06:03.358
What's the second commandment?

0:06:03.441 --> 0:06:04.525
See commandment number one.

0:06:04.609 --> 0:06:06.152
Gotcha.

0:06:07.445 --> 0:06:08.988
You talking out the side
of your neck?

0:06:09.530 --> 0:06:10.573
Come again?

0:06:10.656 --> 0:06:13.576
I said, are you
being a smartass?

0:06:13.659 --> 0:06:16.079
Just trying to fly low,
avoid the radar, boss.

0:06:16.162 --> 0:06:17.955
Do my time... and get out.

0:06:19.332 --> 0:06:21.125
There isn't any flying
under my radar.

0:06:22.126 --> 0:06:23.127
Good to know.

0:06:44.315 --> 0:06:46.609
Hey, can a brother
get some air conditioning up here, cuz?

0:06:46.692 --> 0:06:48.778
It's hotter than
a crack ho's mouth, man.

0:06:48.861 --> 0:06:51.197
To hell with the AC, man.
Give me the crack ho.

0:06:54.659 --> 0:06:55.910
Come on!

0:06:59.205 --> 0:07:00.248
Yo, Fish!

0:07:00.331 --> 0:07:01.707
What you looking at?

0:07:01.791 --> 0:07:03.835
You look kind of pretty
to be up in here, man.

0:07:04.836 --> 0:07:05.711
Fish!

0:07:07.463 --> 0:07:08.965
I suggest you
take a seat, Fish.

0:07:10.508 --> 0:07:12.885
Ain't nothing to do up in here
but serve time.

0:07:12.969 --> 0:07:14.929
Ain't nobody
gonna serve it for you.

0:07:30.695 --> 0:07:32.238
Welcome to
Prisneyland, Fish.

0:07:39.912 --> 0:07:41.747
...is now
on mandatory lockdown...

0:07:59.182 --> 0:08:00.975
You wanna talk
about it?

0:08:01.058 --> 0:08:02.685
No, it's not
worth talking about.

0:08:02.768 --> 0:08:05.021
If it's keeping you up,
it is.

0:08:05.104 --> 0:08:06.689
Oh, it's just...

0:08:06.772 --> 0:08:08.733
It's nothing, you know.

0:08:09.942 --> 0:08:10.943
Michael's case.

0:08:12.111 --> 0:08:13.529
You did the best you could.

0:08:13.613 --> 0:08:15.114
Yeah, but he didn't.

0:08:16.491 --> 0:08:17.408
He just sort of rolled over.

0:08:17.492 --> 0:08:19.118
He didn't put up a fight.

0:08:19.202 --> 0:08:20.077
It's not like him.

0:08:22.205 --> 0:08:24.290
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
be talking about him.

0:08:24.373 --> 0:08:27.293
Hey, if it's on your mind,
it's on your mind, right?

0:08:29.378 --> 0:08:30.671
Good night.

0:08:39.972 --> 0:08:42.266
All wings, guard coming out.

0:08:42.350 --> 0:08:44.310
All wings,
guard coming out.

0:08:48.814 --> 0:08:50.149
Trey Street Deuces
got the hoops.

0:08:50.858 --> 0:08:52.652
Nortenos got the bleachers.

0:08:53.319 --> 0:08:54.779
Woods got the weight pile.

0:08:56.072 --> 0:08:57.657
The C.O.s got the rest.

0:08:57.740 --> 0:09:01.452
I'm telling you, the guards
are the dirtiest gang in this whole place.

0:09:01.536 --> 0:09:03.329
The only difference
between us and them...

0:09:03.412 --> 0:09:04.997
is the badge.

0:09:05.081 --> 0:09:06.040
Who's the pet lover?

0:09:06.123 --> 0:09:07.917
He'll deny it,
but he's D.B. Cooper.

0:09:08.000 --> 0:09:12.088
Parachuted out of a plane
30 years ago with a million and a half in cash.

0:09:12.171 --> 0:09:13.839
Doesn't look
like the type.

0:09:13.923 --> 0:09:14.924
Who does?

0:09:15.007 --> 0:09:17.176
Hey! What up, Wholesale?

0:09:17.260 --> 0:09:18.928
-You okay?
-Gonna be greater later.

0:09:19.011 --> 0:09:19.845
Yeah.

0:09:19.929 --> 0:09:21.472
What you doing
with this fish, man?

0:09:21.556 --> 0:09:22.974
-He's my new cellie.
-Huh.

0:09:23.057 --> 0:09:25.935
Wholesale's got it wired up
at the commissary.

0:09:26.018 --> 0:09:27.812
Anything you want,
he can get it for you.

0:09:27.895 --> 0:09:29.272
You keep
handing out my jacket,

0:09:29.355 --> 0:09:30.731
I swear I'm gonna
bust your grape.

0:09:30.815 --> 0:09:32.775
Man, you couldn't bust a grape in Napa
with a set of cleats on.

0:09:32.858 --> 0:09:34.694
-What are you talking about?
-Man, you want to bump your gums.

0:09:34.777 --> 0:09:36.904
Oh, no, no. Now you're
talking, talking, talking...

0:10:04.765 --> 0:10:06.350
I'm looking for someone.

0:10:08.019 --> 0:10:09.687
Guy named Lincoln Burrows.

0:10:09.770 --> 0:10:11.105
Linc the Sink?

0:10:11.188 --> 0:10:12.607
That what
they're calling him now?

0:10:13.024 --> 0:10:14.275
Yeah.

0:10:14.358 --> 0:10:16.277
As in, he'll come at you
with everything but the kitchen...

0:10:16.360 --> 0:10:17.486
Snowflake.

0:10:17.570 --> 0:10:18.988
Where can I find him?

0:10:20.448 --> 0:10:22.533
Man killed
the Vice President's brother.

0:10:22.617 --> 0:10:24.035
In a month,
he's getting the chair,

0:10:24.118 --> 0:10:26.787
which means no one up this river
is more dangerous than him,

0:10:26.871 --> 0:10:28.205
'cause he's got
nothing to lose now.

0:10:28.289 --> 0:10:30.458
What are they gonna do?
Kill him twice?

0:10:30.541 --> 0:10:31.417
There a way
I can get to him?

0:10:31.500 --> 0:10:33.336
Oh, no. The only time
those boys get out

0:10:33.419 --> 0:10:34.879
is for chapel and P.I.

0:10:35.546 --> 0:10:37.173
P.I.? What's that?

0:10:37.256 --> 0:10:38.174
Prison Industry.

0:10:38.257 --> 0:10:39.967
The guys that get along
get to work.

0:10:40.051 --> 0:10:44.513
You know, painting, scrapping,
making mattresses, you name it.

0:10:44.597 --> 0:10:46.682
I wouldn't get excited, though,
if I were you, Fish.

0:10:46.766 --> 0:10:48.225
You ain't sniffin'
none of P.I.

0:10:48.559 --> 0:10:49.685
Why's that?

0:10:49.769 --> 0:10:51.354
'Cause John Abruzzi runs it.

0:10:52.188 --> 0:10:53.814
"John Abruzzi" John Abruzzi?

0:10:53.898 --> 0:10:56.108
"John Abruzzi" John Abruzzi.

0:10:56.192 --> 0:10:58.277
Why you wanna see Burrows
so bad anyhow?

0:11:02.114 --> 0:11:03.574
Because he's my brother.

0:11:26.806 --> 0:11:27.807
They denied the motion.

0:11:27.890 --> 0:11:28.808
Then do it again.

0:11:28.891 --> 0:11:29.850
I can't. That's it.

0:11:29.934 --> 0:11:32.019
May 11th.
That's the date, man.

0:11:32.103 --> 0:11:33.604
That's the date they,
uh, you know...

0:11:34.271 --> 0:11:35.356
execute me.

0:11:35.856 --> 0:11:37.108
I know.

0:11:42.780 --> 0:11:44.657
I didn't
kill that man, Michael.

0:11:44.740 --> 0:11:46.117
The evidence says you did.

0:11:46.200 --> 0:11:47.660
I don't care
what the evidence says.

0:11:47.743 --> 0:11:48.619
I didn't kill him.

0:11:49.787 --> 0:11:51.080
Swear to me.

0:11:53.124 --> 0:11:54.542
I swear to you, Michael.

0:12:00.297 --> 0:12:02.925
But how did they get it wrong then?

0:12:03.008 --> 0:12:04.468
The courts,
the appeals.

0:12:04.552 --> 0:12:06.929
Don't know. Don't know.

0:12:07.012 --> 0:12:08.889
All I keep thinking,
looking back on it is, uh...

0:12:08.973 --> 0:12:10.015
I was set up.

0:12:11.308 --> 0:12:12.393
And whoever it was
that set me up

0:12:12.476 --> 0:12:14.562
wants me in the ground
as quickly as possible.

0:12:20.151 --> 0:12:21.861
What's another word
for "love"?

0:12:21.944 --> 0:12:23.237
What's the context?

0:12:23.320 --> 0:12:24.572
Oh, you know.

0:12:24.655 --> 0:12:25.990
The "I love you so much

0:12:26.073 --> 0:12:28.826
I ain't never knocking over
a liquor store again" context.

0:12:28.909 --> 0:12:30.327
Except, you know, classy.

0:12:30.619 --> 0:12:32.246
Mmm.

0:12:32.329 --> 0:12:34.206
I'm proposing to my girl,
if you gotta know.

0:12:34.665 --> 0:12:35.583
In a letter?

0:12:35.666 --> 0:12:36.500
You got a better way?

0:12:36.584 --> 0:12:38.294
Face-to-face
works pretty good.

0:12:38.377 --> 0:12:41.505
This place ain't exactly
the romantic spot.

0:12:41.589 --> 0:12:43.924
I'm gonna have her get
on the Staten Island Ferry.

0:12:44.008 --> 0:12:46.552
Then, once she can see
the Empire State Building,

0:12:46.635 --> 0:12:47.928
she opens the letter...

0:12:48.012 --> 0:12:50.097
It's like almost being there.

0:12:50.181 --> 0:12:51.891
Except for the fact
that I won't be there.

0:12:53.225 --> 0:12:54.143
Try "passion."

0:12:54.226 --> 0:12:56.103
Ooh! Ooh! "Passion."
"Passion." That's dope.

0:12:56.854 --> 0:12:58.022
Passion.

0:12:59.690 --> 0:13:00.775
How do you spell that?

0:13:00.858 --> 0:13:02.610
-Is it P-A-S-H?
-Uh-uh.

0:13:04.403 --> 0:13:05.404
No "H"?

0:13:11.827 --> 0:13:13.287
LJ, hold up.

0:13:13.370 --> 0:13:14.955
Hold up.

0:13:15.039 --> 0:13:17.041
I don't think I can
go through with this.

0:13:17.124 --> 0:13:18.542
Everything's going
to be fine.

0:13:19.543 --> 0:13:20.753
Trust me.

0:13:30.930 --> 0:13:32.139
We understand
each other, then?

0:13:32.223 --> 0:13:33.224
-Yeah.
-Friday.

0:13:33.307 --> 0:13:35.559
Not Saturday.
Not Sunday. Friday.

0:13:35.643 --> 0:13:37.144
It's totally understood.

0:13:37.228 --> 0:13:38.896
I don't want hundreds,
I don't want fives, I don't want ones.

0:13:38.979 --> 0:13:39.897
I know, I know.

0:13:39.980 --> 0:13:41.148
Tens and 20s only.

0:13:50.783 --> 0:13:52.535
It's on.

0:14:05.381 --> 0:14:06.674
Police!

0:14:29.822 --> 0:14:32.283
Abruzzi, I need you
to hire me a P.I.

0:14:34.326 --> 0:14:36.078
Beat it.

0:14:36.161 --> 0:14:37.997
Maybe you ought to hear
what I got to say.

0:14:38.080 --> 0:14:39.540
You got nothing I need.

0:14:42.167 --> 0:14:43.544
Wouldn't be
too sure of that.

0:14:44.837 --> 0:14:46.171
My mistake.

0:14:47.131 --> 0:14:50.092
Just what I need... a duck.

0:14:51.051 --> 0:14:52.428
P.I., Abruzzi.

0:14:52.511 --> 0:14:55.139
You might find I can be
of more assistance than you think.

0:14:58.100 --> 0:14:59.310
Mull it over.

0:15:00.561 --> 0:15:02.271
Come find me
when you're ready to talk.

0:15:09.778 --> 0:15:11.780
All right, guys,
pick it up!

0:15:11.864 --> 0:15:13.324
I want to get home tonight!

0:15:13.616 --> 0:15:14.700
Maggio.

0:15:21.874 --> 0:15:23.042
Yeah? So?

0:15:23.125 --> 0:15:24.752
That's the son of a bitch
that fingered Abruzzi.

0:15:26.003 --> 0:15:27.171
That's Fibonacci?

0:15:28.505 --> 0:15:30.716
I thought the punk
was gone forever.

0:15:30.799 --> 0:15:32.718
Evidently,
somebody found him.

0:15:32.801 --> 0:15:34.803
Somebody messing with us?

0:15:34.887 --> 0:15:36.430
This you're not
going to believe.

0:15:40.392 --> 0:15:41.477
What is it?

0:15:46.482 --> 0:15:48.817
Tattoo looks fresh.
Hold that.

0:15:50.235 --> 0:15:52.571
I guess, being a diabetic,
you don't mind needles.

0:15:53.280 --> 0:15:54.990
I'm Michael, by the way.

0:15:55.074 --> 0:15:56.784
Scofield.
I read your report.

0:15:57.576 --> 0:15:58.994
And you are?

0:15:59.078 --> 0:16:00.871
Dr. Tancredi will do.

0:16:00.955 --> 0:16:02.331
"Tancredi" like the governor?

0:16:04.416 --> 0:16:05.793
You're not related,
are you?

0:16:07.378 --> 0:16:09.838
Hmm. Wouldn't think
you'd find the daughter

0:16:09.922 --> 0:16:12.424
of Frontier Justice Frank
working in a prison.

0:16:13.175 --> 0:16:15.177
As a doctor, no less.

0:16:15.260 --> 0:16:18.305
I believe in being part
of the solution, not the problem.

0:16:18.389 --> 0:16:22.601
Hmm. "Be the change you want
to see in the world."

0:16:26.563 --> 0:16:27.439
What?

0:16:29.191 --> 0:16:31.110
Nothing. That was just
my senior quote.

0:16:31.652 --> 0:16:32.653
That was you?

0:16:32.736 --> 0:16:34.697
This whole time,
I was thinking it was Gandhi.

0:16:34.780 --> 0:16:37.366
You're very funny.

0:16:37.449 --> 0:16:39.493
Sit tight.
Put direct pressure on that.

0:16:39.576 --> 0:16:40.619
I'll be back
in a sec.

0:16:55.801 --> 0:16:56.885
So, how do we play this?

0:16:56.969 --> 0:16:59.096
You hook me up
with a few weeks' supply?

0:16:59.179 --> 0:17:01.724
Nice try.
No hypos on the floor.

0:17:01.807 --> 0:17:04.852
I'm the farthest thing
from a junkie. Trust me.

0:17:04.935 --> 0:17:06.228
I got news
for you, Michael.

0:17:06.311 --> 0:17:08.564
"Trust me" means absolutely zero
inside these walls.

0:17:08.647 --> 0:17:10.149
The only way
you're getting that insulin

0:17:10.232 --> 0:17:12.276
is if I'm administering it.

0:17:12.359 --> 0:17:14.570
Guess we'll be seeing
a lot of each other, then, huh?

0:17:15.446 --> 0:17:16.447
I guess so.

0:17:29.460 --> 0:17:31.628
We're all clear
on the Burrows execution.

0:17:31.712 --> 0:17:33.338
-Good.
-Except for one thing.

0:17:33.422 --> 0:17:35.632
Bishop McMorrow
is not in the fold.

0:17:38.343 --> 0:17:40.888
He's got a lot of influence
with the governor.

0:17:40.971 --> 0:17:42.806
They went to prep school
together, apparently.

0:17:44.141 --> 0:17:47.102
Look, the closer it gets,
the more I'm worried

0:17:47.186 --> 0:17:49.396
that the bottom is going
to fall out of this whole thing.

0:17:53.859 --> 0:17:56.528
Well, maybe it's time you arranged a visit
with the good bishop, then.

0:17:58.572 --> 0:18:02.743
Look, in one month,
it'll all be over.

0:18:02.826 --> 0:18:07.206
"The Son of Man must be delivered
into the hands of sinful men

0:18:07.289 --> 0:18:11.168
and be crucified
and the third day, rise again."

0:18:11.251 --> 0:18:15.047
And they remembered His words,
and so should you.

0:18:15.130 --> 0:18:17.299
Good day, gentlemen.
May God be with you.

0:18:22.554 --> 0:18:24.389
Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

0:18:29.812 --> 0:18:31.063
Michael.

0:18:33.690 --> 0:18:35.818
Let's go. Come on, man.
Keep moving.

0:18:35.901 --> 0:18:37.236
Keep moving.
Move. Come on.

0:18:37.319 --> 0:18:39.154
- Why?
- Let's go, man. Come on.

0:18:39.238 --> 0:18:41.156
I'm getting you
out of here.

0:18:41.240 --> 0:18:43.408
Burrows, roll it up.
Happy hour's over.

0:18:44.743 --> 0:18:45.994
It's impossible.

0:18:46.078 --> 0:18:47.663
Not if you designed
the place, it isn't.

0:18:56.588 --> 0:18:57.589
Too formal.

0:19:00.592 --> 0:19:02.177
Too "greeting card."

0:19:02.261 --> 0:19:03.679
Well, we got
to make a decision

0:19:03.762 --> 0:19:05.347
sooner or later,
you know.

0:19:05.430 --> 0:19:06.306
We have time.

0:19:06.390 --> 0:19:09.268
We don't, actually.

0:19:09.351 --> 0:19:12.771
I mean, at some point,
we got to pull the trigger on this thing.

0:19:12.855 --> 0:19:14.356
I don't want
to rush this.

0:19:14.439 --> 0:19:15.649
We're only going
to do it once.

0:19:15.732 --> 0:19:16.733
We have to
get it right.

0:19:22.406 --> 0:19:25.284
Honey, can I
ask you something?

0:19:25.367 --> 0:19:26.285
Of course.

0:19:27.286 --> 0:19:28.704
Are you putting this off?

0:19:28.787 --> 0:19:30.038
What do you mean?

0:19:30.122 --> 0:19:32.040
I mean, are you
having second thoughts?

0:19:32.666 --> 0:19:35.085
No. Honey, no.

0:19:35.711 --> 0:19:36.670
I'm not.

0:19:37.504 --> 0:19:38.714
I don't know.

0:19:38.797 --> 0:19:41.133
-I just can't help thinking this is about--
-It's not.

0:19:42.968 --> 0:19:44.136
I love you.

0:19:45.137 --> 0:19:46.722
And I want
to be your wife.

0:19:50.976 --> 0:19:52.144
Passion?

0:19:52.227 --> 0:19:53.228
What were you thinking?

0:19:53.312 --> 0:19:54.396
Hey, you went for it.

0:19:54.479 --> 0:19:56.565
She probably thinks
I went sissy up in here.

0:19:56.648 --> 0:20:01.111
"Passion." You know,
got more than one syllable, too much talkin'.

0:20:01.195 --> 0:20:03.322
That's me from now on.
One-syllable Sucre.

0:20:03.405 --> 0:20:05.574
Yes. No. Love.

0:20:05.657 --> 0:20:07.075
Hate. Love.

0:20:07.159 --> 0:20:08.410
Give it time.

0:20:08.493 --> 0:20:09.745
Are you kidding?

0:20:09.828 --> 0:20:11.121
I proposed to her.

0:20:11.205 --> 0:20:12.581
That doesn't take time.

0:20:12.664 --> 0:20:13.916
Si or no.

0:20:13.999 --> 0:20:15.083
One syllable, man.

0:20:18.503 --> 0:20:19.504
She's supposed
to come around

0:20:19.588 --> 0:20:21.173
for a conjugal on Tuesday.

0:20:21.256 --> 0:20:22.633
She's always
calling me beforehand,

0:20:22.716 --> 0:20:24.718
letting me know
she's coming.

0:20:24.801 --> 0:20:27.346
This time, man,
I ain't heard a peep.

0:20:28.639 --> 0:20:29.848
You spooked her.

0:20:30.849 --> 0:20:31.934
Scofield.

0:20:32.017 --> 0:20:34.228
Get it together.
Pope wants to see you.

0:20:38.523 --> 0:20:40.025
No good, Fish.

0:20:40.108 --> 0:20:42.152
No one gets an audience
with the Pope.

0:20:42.236 --> 0:20:44.988
Not unless he's real interested
in what you got going on.

0:20:46.198 --> 0:20:48.408
Top of your class at Loyola.

0:20:48.492 --> 0:20:51.453
Magna cum laude, in fact.

0:20:51.536 --> 0:20:54.373
I can't help wondering
what someone with your credentials

0:20:54.456 --> 0:20:56.041
is doing in a place like this.

0:20:57.376 --> 0:21:00.128
Took a wrong turn
a few months back, I guess.

0:21:00.212 --> 0:21:02.256
You make it sound
like a traffic infraction.

0:21:02.339 --> 0:21:05.509
Like all you did was turn the wrong way
up a one-way street.

0:21:05.592 --> 0:21:07.719
Everyone turns up one
sooner or later.

0:21:10.931 --> 0:21:13.642
The reason
I called you here...

0:21:13.725 --> 0:21:16.645
I noticed in your I-file,
under occupation,

0:21:16.728 --> 0:21:18.772
you put down "unemployed."

0:21:19.523 --> 0:21:20.983
That's not true, now, is it?

0:21:24.111 --> 0:21:27.322
I know you're
a structural engineer, Scofield.

0:21:30.534 --> 0:21:33.078
Shah Jahan
built the Taj Majal

0:21:33.161 --> 0:21:36.832
as a monument
to his undying love for his wife.

0:21:36.915 --> 0:21:39.668
My wife is quite fond
of the story.

0:21:39.751 --> 0:21:41.753
It appeals
to the romantic in her.

0:21:43.964 --> 0:21:47.676
Being married to someone
in Corrections, terrible job.

0:21:47.759 --> 0:21:49.219
Wouldn't wish it on anyone.

0:21:49.761 --> 0:21:52.097
And yet, in 39 years,

0:21:52.180 --> 0:21:54.808
my wife
has never complained.

0:21:54.891 --> 0:21:57.227
And the worst part of it is,
I've never thanked her.

0:21:59.730 --> 0:22:02.149
So, because
I couldn't say it,

0:22:02.232 --> 0:22:04.318
I thought, you know,
I could build it.

0:22:05.819 --> 0:22:08.405
Come June,
it's our 40th anniversary.

0:22:10.741 --> 0:22:12.534
But here, look.

0:22:12.617 --> 0:22:13.994
You see,
the problem is,

0:22:14.536 --> 0:22:16.079
I build anymore,

0:22:16.163 --> 0:22:19.207
it's all gonna come down
like a house of cards.

0:22:19.291 --> 0:22:22.377
That's where I was hoping
you could be of assistance.

0:22:22.461 --> 0:22:23.837
For the favor,
I can offer you

0:22:23.920 --> 0:22:26.631
three days of work
a week in here.

0:22:26.715 --> 0:22:28.675
And it'll keep you
off the yard.

0:22:31.595 --> 0:22:32.846
Mmm.

0:22:35.766 --> 0:22:36.975
I can't do it.

0:22:38.977 --> 0:22:42.397
Son, it's better for me
to owe you one in here

0:22:42.481 --> 0:22:43.774
than it is for you
to owe me one,

0:22:43.857 --> 0:22:45.317
I can promise you that.

0:22:45.984 --> 0:22:47.319
I'll take my chances.

0:22:50.447 --> 0:22:51.782
Then we're through here.

0:22:52.991 --> 0:22:54.117
Guard!

0:22:56.953 --> 0:22:59.247
Two pounds of pot?

0:22:59.331 --> 0:23:00.957
What were you trying to do,
set a record?

0:23:01.625 --> 0:23:03.043
It's not funny, LJ.

0:23:03.126 --> 0:23:04.669
You could be going
to jail.

0:23:06.129 --> 0:23:08.673
It's pretty obvious to me
you need some guidance.

0:23:10.884 --> 0:23:11.802
Hey.

0:23:12.677 --> 0:23:13.678
Thanks.

0:23:16.181 --> 0:23:17.349
From who,
old Daddy Warbucks?

0:23:17.432 --> 0:23:19.309
Give him a chance.
He's a good man.

0:23:19.393 --> 0:23:21.311
We got nothing in common.

0:23:21.395 --> 0:23:23.688
Come on. Where is this
coming from, LJ?

0:23:23.772 --> 0:23:26.650
Last semester you were getting
almost all A's and now...

0:23:30.320 --> 0:23:31.905
It's your father, isn't it?

0:23:31.988 --> 0:23:33.198
I don't have a father.

0:23:33.281 --> 0:23:35.200
It wasn't an immaculate
conception, honey.

0:23:35.283 --> 0:23:36.493
Trust me.

0:23:39.579 --> 0:23:41.373
Maybe it's time
we went and saw him.

0:23:42.707 --> 0:23:43.667
Mom...

0:23:44.084 --> 0:23:44.960
Mom.

0:23:45.836 --> 0:23:46.795
Don't.

0:23:46.878 --> 0:23:48.255
I'm about as excited
by the prospect as you are,

0:23:48.338 --> 0:23:50.006
but something's gotta give.

0:23:50.090 --> 0:23:51.425
You have got
too much potential

0:23:51.508 --> 0:23:53.385
to be screwing up
your life like this.

0:23:57.389 --> 0:24:01.435
What if they'd sent you
to Taylorville or Marion and not here?

0:24:01.518 --> 0:24:04.020
I think I'd be doing
the same thing I'm doing in here.

0:24:04.104 --> 0:24:06.273
Eating Jell-O,
drinking Kool-Aid...

0:24:06.356 --> 0:24:08.024
I know what you're doing.

0:24:08.108 --> 0:24:10.652
It's not the luck of the draw
that you're in here with Lincoln.

0:24:11.903 --> 0:24:13.029
You forget I know you.

0:24:13.113 --> 0:24:14.531
Both of you.

0:24:14.614 --> 0:24:17.826
You two have the most
dysfunctional idea of love I've ever seen.

0:24:17.909 --> 0:24:20.454
What, he beats you up
to keep you off the streets,

0:24:20.537 --> 0:24:22.831
so you get yourself tossed
into Fox River with him?

0:24:23.540 --> 0:24:24.666
To what?

0:24:24.749 --> 0:24:25.834
Save him?

0:24:28.170 --> 0:24:29.171
I deserve to know.

0:24:29.254 --> 0:24:31.131
I loved him
as much as you did.

0:24:31.214 --> 0:24:34.468
Past tense for you, maybe.
Not me.

0:24:34.551 --> 0:24:37.596
I gave him a shot
when I got back from college. I did.

0:24:37.679 --> 0:24:39.347
Even with all the stuff
that was going on with him,

0:24:39.431 --> 0:24:41.141
I did everything I could
to make it work.

0:24:41.224 --> 0:24:42.434
And he threw it away.

0:24:42.517 --> 0:24:44.144
You ever think maybe he was hurt
that you left

0:24:44.227 --> 0:24:45.353
in the first place?

0:24:46.396 --> 0:24:47.939
Don't do this.

0:24:48.023 --> 0:24:49.816
Whatever it is you're doing,
don't do it.

0:24:49.900 --> 0:24:50.859
There's a better way.

0:24:50.942 --> 0:24:52.110
I'm already appealing
your case.

0:24:52.194 --> 0:24:53.945
I told you
to leave that alone.

0:24:54.029 --> 0:24:55.780
I've gotten in touch with the diocese about Lincoln.
The bishop may be able to help.

0:24:55.864 --> 0:24:58.074
That won't stop it.
It'll only delay it.

0:25:02.245 --> 0:25:04.498
You want
to do something?

0:25:04.581 --> 0:25:06.333
You find out
who's trying to bury him.

0:25:09.294 --> 0:25:11.338
Nobody's trying to bury him.

0:25:11.421 --> 0:25:13.048
The evidence was there.

0:25:13.131 --> 0:25:14.591
The evidence was cooked.

0:25:17.385 --> 0:25:19.930
Visiting hours
are now over.

0:25:24.768 --> 0:25:26.353
Take care of yourself.

0:25:28.271 --> 0:25:30.482
Someone wants him
dead, Veronica.

0:25:30.565 --> 0:25:32.567
Something more
is going on here.

0:25:33.401 --> 0:25:34.611
This is desperation, Michael.

0:25:34.694 --> 0:25:36.738
You're grabbing at straws.
You're in denial.

0:25:36.821 --> 0:25:37.656
Maybe.

0:25:37.739 --> 0:25:38.990
But I can't watch him die.

0:25:39.783 --> 0:25:40.742
I won't do that.

0:26:10.981 --> 0:26:12.232
Gentlemen...

0:26:12.315 --> 0:26:15.151
What is it about the Burrows situation
that I can help you with?

0:26:15.235 --> 0:26:18.154
It's our understanding
that you have great influence with the governor.

0:26:18.238 --> 0:26:22.742
I wouldn't say it's "great" or "influence."

0:26:22.826 --> 0:26:24.077
We're friends.

0:26:24.160 --> 0:26:27.038
It's also our understanding
that you oppose the death penalty.

0:26:27.122 --> 0:26:28.873
I'm a man of God.
How could I not?

0:26:28.957 --> 0:26:32.168
In this case, we're hoping
you'll suspend that position.

0:26:32.252 --> 0:26:33.878
At least temporarily.

0:26:33.962 --> 0:26:37.966
If the inmate appeals
to me for intervention,

0:26:38.049 --> 0:26:39.509
how can I
turn my back on him?

0:26:39.593 --> 0:26:42.554
You have a habit of answering
a question with a question.

0:26:42.637 --> 0:26:45.932
And you have a way of asking questions
that beg more questions.

0:26:50.645 --> 0:26:52.147
Are you saying
you won't do it?

0:26:52.230 --> 0:26:53.898
I'm not a man to equivocate.

0:26:57.736 --> 0:27:00.822
You're, what, 62 years old now,
Your Excellency.

0:27:00.905 --> 0:27:01.823
That's right.

0:27:01.906 --> 0:27:03.283
I would assume, then,
that you'd be well-versed

0:27:03.366 --> 0:27:05.285
in how our government's
tax system works.

0:27:05.368 --> 0:27:07.037
Taking personal
capital gains

0:27:07.120 --> 0:27:09.247
under the church's
tax shelter...

0:27:09.331 --> 0:27:11.374
that would be fraud,
wouldn't it, Your Excellency?

0:27:12.626 --> 0:27:16.463
I will not be cowed
into forsaking my beliefs.

0:27:17.130 --> 0:27:18.923
Not by you or anyone else.

0:27:20.175 --> 0:27:21.468
Admirable.

0:27:22.344 --> 0:27:23.887
Good day, Excellency.

0:27:24.929 --> 0:27:25.889
Mr. Kellerman...

0:27:27.432 --> 0:27:31.645
What is it about this case
that the Secret Service is so interested in?

0:27:31.728 --> 0:27:33.813
The man killed
the Vice President's brother.

0:27:42.072 --> 0:27:42.947
What'd you say?

0:27:43.031 --> 0:27:44.032
You heard me.

0:27:44.115 --> 0:27:45.700
Someone found Fibonacci.

0:27:45.784 --> 0:27:47.702
I'm looking at the photos
right now.

0:27:47.786 --> 0:27:50.205
Son of a bitch
has got a beard, sunglasses...

0:27:50.288 --> 0:27:51.956
Witness protection,
if I ever saw it.

0:27:52.540 --> 0:27:53.875
Who was this someone?

0:27:53.958 --> 0:27:56.086
Don't know, there's no return address
on the envelope.

0:27:56.920 --> 0:27:59.047
Just...

0:27:59.130 --> 0:28:01.675
this folded-up bird
made of paper.

0:28:04.094 --> 0:28:05.387
Like origami?

0:28:05.470 --> 0:28:06.596
Yeah, like that.

0:28:07.305 --> 0:28:08.598
Like origami.

0:28:42.799 --> 0:28:45.009
You're Charles Westmoreland,
right?

0:28:45.093 --> 0:28:46.136
Do I know you?

0:28:46.219 --> 0:28:48.388
I knew your wife
before she passed.

0:28:48.930 --> 0:28:49.931
You knew Marla?

0:28:50.014 --> 0:28:50.932
You mean Ann?

0:28:51.975 --> 0:28:53.268
How'd you know her?

0:28:53.351 --> 0:28:55.228
We taught together
in Boston.

0:28:55.311 --> 0:28:56.354
East Farmington.

0:28:56.438 --> 0:28:57.647
You mean West Wilmington?

0:28:59.023 --> 0:29:00.316
No more tests.

0:29:00.817 --> 0:29:01.901
I promise.

0:29:03.236 --> 0:29:04.988
Seems you know
everything about me.

0:29:05.697 --> 0:29:06.531
Who are you?

0:29:06.614 --> 0:29:07.490
Michael Scofield.

0:29:08.324 --> 0:29:10.118
How'd you get it in here?

0:29:10.201 --> 0:29:12.328
First off,
she's not an "it."

0:29:12.412 --> 0:29:14.581
She's Marilyn,
and she's grandfathered

0:29:14.664 --> 0:29:18.835
back from the days
when prisoners were allowed a creature comfort or two.

0:29:19.669 --> 0:29:21.212
I heard
you were D.B. Cooper.

0:29:23.214 --> 0:29:25.091
Every new fish
comes in here,

0:29:25.175 --> 0:29:26.301
first thing they hear,

0:29:26.384 --> 0:29:29.262
is that Charles Westmoreland
is D.B. Cooper.

0:29:29.345 --> 0:29:31.139
I'll tell you
like I tell them...

0:29:32.557 --> 0:29:34.434
You want the Cooper story?

0:29:34.517 --> 0:29:37.771
I can't give it to you,
'cause I'm not him.

0:29:37.854 --> 0:29:38.688
It's too bad.

0:29:38.772 --> 0:29:40.523
Sort of wish it was true.

0:29:40.607 --> 0:29:41.941
The man's a legend.

0:29:42.025 --> 0:29:44.944
Nowhere near as much
as I wish it were true, friend.

0:29:45.028 --> 0:29:47.864
I'd have a million-five
waiting for me on the outside.

0:29:50.867 --> 0:29:53.203
I'd put some grass
under 'em if I were you.

0:29:54.579 --> 0:29:57.207
This thing would go
a whole lot easier if you'd just hire me.

0:29:58.208 --> 0:29:59.751
What is this all about?

0:30:00.835 --> 0:30:02.837
Say you were able
to get outside those walls...

0:30:03.755 --> 0:30:04.839
would you have
the people in place

0:30:04.923 --> 0:30:06.966
to make sure
you disappeared forever?

0:30:07.050 --> 0:30:08.009
What do you care?

0:30:08.468 --> 0:30:09.969
Just curious.

0:30:10.053 --> 0:30:11.638
Where's Fibonacci?

0:30:11.721 --> 0:30:13.223
That's not the way
it works.

0:30:17.936 --> 0:30:20.897
They come at me, John,
I'm coming after you.

0:30:22.106 --> 0:30:23.107
I doubt it.

0:30:25.527 --> 0:30:27.111
Fight, fight, fight...

0:30:50.426 --> 0:30:51.928
All right.

0:30:58.142 --> 0:30:59.310
Get on the ground.

0:31:01.938 --> 0:31:03.940
I totally
misjudged you, Scofield.

0:31:04.023 --> 0:31:06.401
I didn't think
you were the agitating type.

0:31:06.484 --> 0:31:09.404
Behavior like that
will not be tolerated in my prison.

0:31:09.487 --> 0:31:10.613
Ninety days in the SHU!

0:31:10.697 --> 0:31:12.699
That ought to be enough time
to convince you of that fact.

0:31:12.782 --> 0:31:13.616
Ninety days?

0:31:13.700 --> 0:31:14.576
That's right.

0:31:22.792 --> 0:31:24.294
Something you want to say?

0:31:25.003 --> 0:31:27.046
It's just...

0:31:27.130 --> 0:31:28.756
I'm not of much value
to you in the SHU.

0:31:29.424 --> 0:31:30.258
Value?

0:31:30.341 --> 0:31:32.385
Hmm... The Taj.

0:31:32.468 --> 0:31:34.470
It'd be a shame
for the eighth wonder of the modern world

0:31:34.554 --> 0:31:37.682
to collapse because the stress
isn't properly propagated.

0:31:37.765 --> 0:31:38.850
Properly propagated?

0:31:38.933 --> 0:31:40.643
Properly propagated.

0:31:40.727 --> 0:31:42.270
The joints are overloaded.

0:31:42.353 --> 0:31:44.647
They won't provide anywhere
near the sheer strength

0:31:44.731 --> 0:31:46.149
the completed structure
will need.

0:31:47.817 --> 0:31:49.319
How much work
are we talking?

0:31:50.028 --> 0:31:51.362
You want it by when, June?

0:31:51.446 --> 0:31:52.488
Yes.

0:31:52.572 --> 0:31:55.158
Then we'd better get started,
wouldn't you say?

0:32:22.393 --> 0:32:23.436
Who's there?

0:32:41.871 --> 0:32:43.831
Bishop McMorrow
was killed last night.

0:32:43.915 --> 0:32:45.541
Someone shot him
while he was sleeping.

0:32:46.876 --> 0:32:48.252
I thought
you'd want to know.

0:32:48.920 --> 0:32:49.796
Thanks.

0:32:57.553 --> 0:32:58.680
Michael was right.

0:33:28.543 --> 0:33:30.128
Sink, you got a visitor.

0:33:42.974 --> 0:33:44.392
He was arrested.

0:33:45.977 --> 0:33:47.186
For what?

0:33:47.270 --> 0:33:48.688
Possession of marijuana.

0:33:51.816 --> 0:33:55.111
I figured he could use
some fatherly advice before it's...

0:33:56.404 --> 0:33:58.614
-Gone forever?
-I didn't mean that.

0:33:58.698 --> 0:34:00.033
I know you didn't.

0:34:00.116 --> 0:34:01.200
Thanks, Lisa.

0:34:02.952 --> 0:34:04.120
Sit down.

0:34:09.292 --> 0:34:10.126
Dope, huh?

0:34:10.793 --> 0:34:12.003
Using or dealing?

0:34:13.629 --> 0:34:14.881
What's the difference?

0:34:14.964 --> 0:34:18.301
Then what, you, uh, think it gives you
some kind of street cred?

0:34:20.303 --> 0:34:21.554
You got a piece
of the good life.

0:34:21.637 --> 0:34:22.638
Take advantage.

0:34:23.973 --> 0:34:25.475
Look, I get it.

0:34:25.558 --> 0:34:27.143
The whole thing.

0:34:27.226 --> 0:34:29.145
She drags me in here,

0:34:29.228 --> 0:34:30.605
you give me a big speech,

0:34:30.688 --> 0:34:32.690
I walk away a changed man.

0:34:32.774 --> 0:34:34.025
Straight A's.

0:34:34.108 --> 0:34:36.944
Harvard.
Grow up and be a dentist.

0:34:37.028 --> 0:34:38.279
It's better than being here.

0:34:40.865 --> 0:34:42.075
You got to realize
who's getting punished

0:34:42.158 --> 0:34:43.910
when you're doing
the things you're doing.

0:34:43.993 --> 0:34:45.745
You think it's me.
It's you.

0:34:45.828 --> 0:34:47.205
I did the same thing.

0:34:47.288 --> 0:34:48.748
Punished the old man
'cause he was gone.

0:34:48.831 --> 0:34:49.749
Look what it got me.

0:34:54.003 --> 0:34:56.380
I'm not asking you
to love me.

0:34:56.464 --> 0:34:59.383
I already screwed up
that chance long ago.

0:34:59.467 --> 0:35:01.677
I'm asking you
to love yourself.

0:35:01.761 --> 0:35:03.679
You can still put the brakes
on this thing.

0:35:06.057 --> 0:35:08.017
So, that's what
fatherly advice is like.

0:35:09.477 --> 0:35:10.520
Where are you going?

0:35:11.729 --> 0:35:13.064
I got homework.

0:35:14.023 --> 0:35:16.067
They're putting me
to death, LJ.

0:35:16.150 --> 0:35:17.735
In a month's time,
I'll be dead.

0:35:18.861 --> 0:35:19.737
You get that?

0:35:20.822 --> 0:35:23.199
You're already
dead to me.

0:35:48.975 --> 0:35:50.518
Yes.

0:35:50.601 --> 0:35:53.521
What? You mean "yes," yes?

0:35:53.604 --> 0:35:54.647
Yes!

0:35:54.730 --> 0:35:56.023
- Yeah!
- Yes!

0:35:58.484 --> 0:36:00.570
-Oh, there's just one thing.
-Of course.

0:36:00.653 --> 0:36:02.029
Mama wants us to wait
till you get out.

0:36:02.113 --> 0:36:03.197
Of course, mi amor.

0:36:03.281 --> 0:36:04.490
Oh, and we have
to get married in a church.

0:36:04.574 --> 0:36:06.659
-Okay. Esta bien.
-A Catholic church.

0:36:06.742 --> 0:36:08.953
Wouldn't want to mess
with the Catholic roots, would we?

0:36:15.751 --> 0:36:16.836
You went to Loyola.

0:36:16.919 --> 0:36:18.337
You've been
checking up on me.

0:36:18.421 --> 0:36:20.256
I like to get to know
my patients.

0:36:20.339 --> 0:36:22.341
I went to Northwestern.
Graduated two years after you did.

0:36:22.425 --> 0:36:24.969
Maybe we met before,
you know, drunk,

0:36:25.052 --> 0:36:26.429
out at a bar somewhere.

0:36:26.512 --> 0:36:27.597
I would have remembered.

0:36:27.680 --> 0:36:29.265
-That a compliment?
-No.

0:36:30.725 --> 0:36:31.601
Hmm.

0:36:32.894 --> 0:36:34.020
What?

0:36:34.103 --> 0:36:36.772
Your blood glucose is at
50 milligrams per deciliter.

0:36:36.856 --> 0:36:38.900
-So?
-That's hypoglycemic.

0:36:38.983 --> 0:36:40.526
Your body's reacting
to the insulin

0:36:40.610 --> 0:36:41.694
like you're not a diabetic.

0:36:41.777 --> 0:36:43.779
You're sure it's type 1 diabetes
you've got?

0:36:43.863 --> 0:36:45.156
Ever since I was a kid.

0:36:46.449 --> 0:36:47.533
All right.

0:36:47.617 --> 0:36:49.368
Not experiencing
any tingling sensation, cold sweats--

0:36:53.873 --> 0:36:55.124
Infirmary.

0:36:55.374 --> 0:36:56.417
Yes.

0:36:57.752 --> 0:36:59.420
Yeah. I did.

0:37:00.796 --> 0:37:03.633
No, I did and I do.
I need them.

0:37:03.716 --> 0:37:07.386
Okay. Um, great.
Well, I'll call him after lunch, then.

0:37:07.470 --> 0:37:09.347
Thanks.
I'm with a patient. Okay.

0:37:10.556 --> 0:37:12.808
I'd like to run some tests
next time you're in.

0:37:12.892 --> 0:37:16.145
Last thing I want is to be
administering insulin to a man who doesn't need it.

0:37:16.604 --> 0:37:18.064
Yeah, sure.

0:37:18.773 --> 0:37:20.024
Okay.

0:37:26.739 --> 0:37:28.199
How'd you get here,
by the way?

0:37:28.658 --> 0:37:30.159
Oh, you know.

0:37:31.160 --> 0:37:32.745
I don't.
That's why I asked.

0:37:32.828 --> 0:37:35.414
You know. Hector.

0:37:35.498 --> 0:37:36.415
What?

0:37:36.499 --> 0:37:38.125
I didn't have any money
for the bus,

0:37:38.209 --> 0:37:39.585
so he offered me a ride.

0:37:40.044 --> 0:37:41.420
He was really sweet.

0:37:43.339 --> 0:37:44.966
Honey, he's just a friend.

0:37:45.049 --> 0:37:46.050
No, he's not
just a friend.

0:37:46.133 --> 0:37:48.010
I know Hector.
I know men.

0:37:48.094 --> 0:37:49.303
Men and women
can't be friends.

0:37:49.387 --> 0:37:52.139
A guy doesn't drive a girl
500 miles across state lines

0:37:52.223 --> 0:37:53.349
because he wants
to be friends.

0:37:53.432 --> 0:37:55.393
Casanova, wrap it up.

0:37:56.560 --> 0:38:00.147
Hey, you got nothing
to worry about, okay?

0:38:00.231 --> 0:38:02.275
It's you I'm marrying.

0:38:02.358 --> 0:38:04.110
It's not you
I'm worried about.

0:38:06.737 --> 0:38:08.197
Sixteen more months.

0:38:17.039 --> 0:38:18.332
I love you.

0:38:29.969 --> 0:38:32.054
Be easy, son, all right?

0:38:37.935 --> 0:38:40.062
Sucre tells me
you're the local pharmacy.

0:38:44.150 --> 0:38:46.277
-What you need, man?
-PUGNAc.

0:38:46.360 --> 0:38:48.529
I only speak English,
white boy.

0:38:48.612 --> 0:38:49.822
It's an insulin blocker.

0:38:49.905 --> 0:38:51.532
Standard
over-the-counter variety.

0:38:51.615 --> 0:38:52.700
You can get it
at any pharmacy.

0:38:52.783 --> 0:38:54.118
You can get that
at medical then.

0:38:54.201 --> 0:38:55.578
I can't get it at medical.

0:38:56.370 --> 0:38:57.288
Why not?

0:38:57.371 --> 0:38:59.415
Because they're already
giving me insulin shots.

0:39:01.250 --> 0:39:03.836
You're one mixed-up cracker,
you know that?

0:39:03.919 --> 0:39:05.296
Can you get it for me,
or not?

0:39:06.255 --> 0:39:08.215
Only if you tell me
why is it you want

0:39:08.299 --> 0:39:09.508
to keep going
back up to medical

0:39:09.592 --> 0:39:11.510
to get an insulin shot
for which you don't need.

0:39:12.136 --> 0:39:13.721
I like the ambiance.

0:39:13.804 --> 0:39:14.972
Uh-huh.

0:39:15.514 --> 0:39:16.724
Are we in business?

0:39:22.480 --> 0:39:23.731
All personnel,

0:39:23.814 --> 0:39:26.025
Facility Two lockdown
in 20 minutes.

0:39:26.108 --> 0:39:29.070
Facility One lockdown
in ten minutes.

0:39:32.531 --> 0:39:34.742
Scofield. I don't know
what you did,

0:39:34.825 --> 0:39:37.244
but Abruzzi wanted me
to give you this P.I. card.

0:39:37.995 --> 0:39:38.954
Congratulations.

0:39:39.038 --> 0:39:41.082
You just joined the ranks
of the employed.

0:39:57.556 --> 0:39:59.016
Kudos, Fish.

0:39:59.600 --> 0:40:01.018
You got spine.

0:40:06.857 --> 0:40:09.026
All right, cons,
break it down!

0:40:11.445 --> 0:40:12.738
Move it, guys.

0:40:25.042 --> 0:40:27.128
Saw Veronica
came by yesterday.

0:40:27.211 --> 0:40:28.337
Still engaged to that guy?

0:40:28.421 --> 0:40:29.296
Yup.

0:40:30.047 --> 0:40:30.965
Could have been me.

0:40:31.048 --> 0:40:32.550
If you hadn't
self-destructed.

0:40:33.926 --> 0:40:35.886
You think I meant
to knock up Lisa Rix?

0:40:36.637 --> 0:40:37.847
I was just being stupid.

0:40:38.097 --> 0:40:39.098
Hurt.

0:40:40.558 --> 0:40:42.101
Shouldn't have
pushed her away, though.

0:40:42.184 --> 0:40:43.310
You pushed everyone away.

0:40:45.062 --> 0:40:46.480
I'm an anchor.

0:40:46.564 --> 0:40:48.274
All I'll do
is drag him down with me.

0:40:53.737 --> 0:40:55.281
Why did you hire him?

0:40:55.364 --> 0:40:56.740
Keep your friends close

0:40:56.824 --> 0:40:58.826
and your enemies closer.

0:41:04.331 --> 0:41:05.583
You mean
what you said earlier?

0:41:05.666 --> 0:41:07.793
I'm not here on vacation,
trust me.

0:41:09.253 --> 0:41:11.755
Getting outside these walls,
that's just the beginning.

0:41:12.423 --> 0:41:13.799
You're going to need money.

0:41:17.261 --> 0:41:18.888
I'll have it.

0:41:18.971 --> 0:41:20.681
And people
on the outside...

0:41:20.764 --> 0:41:22.308
People that can
help you disappear.

0:41:23.142 --> 0:41:24.518
I've already got them.

0:41:25.436 --> 0:41:26.896
They just
don't know it yet.

0:41:32.276 --> 0:41:34.195
Look, whatever you got
going on, fill me in,

0:41:34.278 --> 0:41:35.321
'cause I'm in the dark here.

0:41:37.448 --> 0:41:39.325
Chaparral Associates
got the contract

0:41:39.408 --> 0:41:41.118
to retrofit
this place in '99.

0:41:41.202 --> 0:41:42.536
Four million dollar contract.

0:41:42.620 --> 0:41:44.205
Head partner
couldn't crack it.

0:41:44.288 --> 0:41:47.333
So, he subcontracted out,
an under-the-table sort of deal

0:41:47.416 --> 0:41:48.584
with a former associate.

0:41:48.667 --> 0:41:51.253
That guy was one
of the partners in my firm.

0:41:53.589 --> 0:41:55.090
We basically ghost-wrote
the whole plan.

0:41:55.174 --> 0:41:57.885
Crossed the t's, dotted the i's,
grouted the tiles.

0:42:07.645 --> 0:42:08.896
You've seen the blueprints.

0:42:08.979 --> 0:42:10.022
Better than that.

0:42:11.565 --> 0:42:12.900
I've got them on me.

0:42:17.321 --> 0:42:18.572
Are you kidding me?

0:42:21.992 --> 0:42:24.078
Am I supposed to be seeing
something here?

0:42:24.161 --> 0:42:25.287
Look closer.

0:43:42.364 --> 0:43:44.158
Captioned by Point.360.
