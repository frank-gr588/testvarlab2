Garrett: Today just keeps
getting better and better.

903
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,276
First, superpowers,
now a spaceship.

904
00:38:34,276 --> 00:38:37,153
Can I get
a "best day ever"?!

905
00:38:37,153 --> 00:38:38,631
Best day ever!

906
00:38:38,631 --> 00:38:41,148
If duct tape doesn't work,
I can liquify a femur or two.

907
00:38:41,148 --> 00:38:42,347

ran the numbers,

00:38:52,377 --> 00:38:54,215
and every outcome
where we don't come out on top

912
00:38:54,215 --> 00:38:55,813
has one thing in common.

913
00:38:56,732 --> 00:38:58,131
Fitz.

914
00:38:58,131 --> 00:39:00,848
He's gotten in our way
long enough.
