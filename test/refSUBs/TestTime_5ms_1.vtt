0:00:26.108 --> 0:00:28.806
Sorry guys, I just wanted to upload a subtitle in order to upgrade my allowed daily downloads.
Now I am not a sub leecher <3
Sorry again and have a nice day :)

0:00:28.936 --> 0:00:30.242
Can I gave you a hand?

0:00:30.373 --> 0:00:32.114
If I needed a hand,
I'd ask for it...

0:00:32.244 --> 0:00:34.072
Thank you very much.

0:00:57.139 --> 0:00:58.227
There you go, miss.Thanks.

0:01:01.012 --> 0:01:03.275
Marion.
How's it going?

0:01:03.406 --> 0:01:05.886
Eh. Could be worse.
Brain's still working.

0:01:06.017 --> 0:01:08.367
Is it a pastrami day?

0:01:08.498 --> 0:01:11.327
Yeah. Uh, one
and a quarter pounds. You got it.

0:01:11.457 --> 0:01:14.112
Not a pound and a half,
you overshot last time.

0:01:14.243 --> 0:01:17.028
Oh.
Sorry 'bout that.

0:01:17.159 --> 0:01:19.291
What do we have here?

0:01:19.422 --> 0:01:22.555
Extra-sharp Wisconsin cheddar.

0:01:22.686 --> 0:01:24.905
"Extra-sharp," hmm?

0:01:28.648 --> 0:01:30.955
Ohh.

0:01:31.086 --> 0:01:33.958
You can keep it, Wisconsin.
Ugh.

0:02:01.290 --> 0:02:03.901
It wasn't like this
when I came before.

0:02:17.044 --> 0:02:18.524
Need some help?

0:02:18.655 --> 0:02:20.613
I'm fine!

0:02:25.314 --> 0:02:27.403
Are you sure
you don't want a push?

0:02:27.533 --> 0:02:29.361
I'm sure.

0:02:34.018 --> 0:02:36.194
What happened to poor Nippy?

0:02:36.325 --> 0:02:40.198
Ah. It was my fault.

0:02:40.329 --> 0:02:42.244
I was driving
with the windows open,

0:02:42.374 --> 0:02:44.333
you know, before all this hit.

0:02:44.463 --> 0:02:46.180
And... I don't know...
Something got into him.

0:02:46.204 --> 0:02:48.250
He saw a cat or something...
But he jumped.

0:02:48.380 --> 0:02:49.599
Oh, no.

0:02:49.729 --> 0:02:50.904
I pulled right over,

0:02:51.035 --> 0:02:52.906
screaming my head off,
"Nippyyyy!"

0:02:53.037 --> 0:02:55.387
Ohh.But... he was gone.

0:02:55.518 --> 0:02:57.433
Oh, that's terrible.

0:02:57.563 --> 0:03:00.044
I hope you find him.

0:03:00.175 --> 0:03:01.350
If you could keep an eye out.

0:03:01.480 --> 0:03:02.829
Yeah, I will.
Sure.

0:03:02.960 --> 0:03:05.615
I-I live right over here
on... on Clementine.

0:03:05.745 --> 0:03:07.225
This is my route.

0:03:07.356 --> 0:03:10.446
When I can get this thing going.

0:03:12.578 --> 0:03:14.972
Maybe just a little push.

0:03:17.061 --> 0:03:18.802
Well, if you're sure
you don't mind.

0:03:18.932 --> 0:03:20.499
Nah.
I'm happy to help.

0:03:31.989 --> 0:03:33.208
Okay.
Throw it in neutral.

0:03:33.338 --> 0:03:36.428
And one, two, three.

0:03:40.084 --> 0:03:40.867
There you go.

0:03:40.998 --> 0:03:43.087
Oh, sorry for the trouble.

0:03:43.218 --> 0:03:45.437
Put it back in drive.
Not at all.

0:03:45.568 --> 0:03:48.266
Have a nice day. Yeah, you too.

0:03:48.397 --> 0:03:49.963
Hope you find Nippy.

0:03:50.094 --> 0:03:52.227
Thank you.

0:03:54.925 --> 0:03:57.841
Ohh.
What in the world?

0:04:08.155 --> 0:04:09.635
How ya doing, Marion?

0:04:09.766 --> 0:04:11.246
Great. Ah, good.

0:04:11.376 --> 0:04:13.335
Are you okay? Oh, yeah.

0:05:29.236 --> 0:05:30.716
Okay, okay, okay.

0:05:30.847 --> 0:05:33.545
Actually,
it's my favorite meal to cook.

0:05:33.676 --> 0:05:36.853
Hmm. I like it. And I think
my secret is...

0:05:36.983 --> 0:05:38.289
Ma?

0:05:38.420 --> 0:05:40.552
In the kitchen, Jeffie!

0:05:40.683 --> 0:05:41.988
I have a little trick.

0:05:42.119 --> 0:05:43.773
I bet it's the same
we do in my family.

0:05:43.903 --> 0:05:45.340
An egg.
I knew it.

0:05:45.470 --> 0:05:47.080
And you really work it in.

0:05:47.211 --> 0:05:48.821
I mean, you got to use
your hands.

0:05:48.952 --> 0:05:50.475
You are speaking my language.

0:05:50.606 --> 0:05:54.087
Do you cook? Uh, just a few favorites,
nothing fancy.

0:05:54.218 --> 0:05:56.394
Yeah, simple's best.
I mean, why fuss?

0:05:56.525 --> 0:06:00.746
Oh. Jeffie, this is Mr. Takavic.

0:06:00.877 --> 0:06:03.749
Oh, please,
Mr. Takavic was my father.

0:06:03.880 --> 0:06:06.752
Call me "Gene."

0:06:06.883 --> 0:06:09.842
Don't worry, hon,
he's not an ax murderer.

0:06:09.973 --> 0:06:13.063
If he was gonna chop me to bits
he'd have done it already.

0:06:13.193 --> 0:06:15.979
Right, Gene?

0:06:17.894 --> 0:06:22.420
Well, don't just stand there
like a bump on a log, join us.

0:06:24.814 --> 0:06:27.686
Sometimes he gets a little
nervous around new people.

0:06:27.817 --> 0:06:29.732
Ma... Well, you do.

0:06:29.862 --> 0:06:31.037
Now come on.

0:06:31.168 --> 0:06:34.171
Grab a glass and sit down.

0:06:45.225 --> 0:06:46.575
Tell him how we met, Gene.

0:06:46.705 --> 0:06:47.706
Oh, yeah.

0:06:47.837 --> 0:06:49.926
Uh, well,
I was looking for Nippy...

0:06:50.056 --> 0:06:51.056
Yeah.
His dog, poor thing.

0:06:51.144 --> 0:06:52.363
Well, he ran away.

0:06:52.494 --> 0:06:54.365
And Gene here
was putting up posters.

0:06:54.496 --> 0:06:56.336
And your mom was on her way back
from Hansen's.

0:06:56.367 --> 0:06:58.630
And my wheels got stuck
in the snow.

0:06:58.761 --> 0:07:00.391
Well, that was before
the whole thing conked out.

0:07:00.415 --> 0:07:03.330
Yeah, but Gene here
saved the day.

0:07:03.461 --> 0:07:06.899
He even fixed my dumb scooter...
With duct tape!

0:07:07.030 --> 0:07:10.250
Ah.

0:07:10.381 --> 0:07:12.035
To Gene. Come on.

0:07:12.165 --> 0:07:13.732
Yeah.Ahh...

0:07:16.692 --> 0:07:19.608
Mm.

0:07:19.738 --> 0:07:24.569
So your mom tells me
you're a cab driver?

0:07:27.267 --> 0:07:30.880
Have you ever driven
anyone famous?

0:07:31.010 --> 0:07:32.272
Oh, he sure did.

0:07:32.403 --> 0:07:33.665
Tell him, Jeffie.

0:07:38.322 --> 0:07:39.845
Sammy Hagar.

0:07:39.976 --> 0:07:41.717
No!
The Red Rocker?!

0:07:41.847 --> 0:07:42.979
Hey, I love him.

0:07:47.026 --> 0:07:48.026
That's it! Hey!

0:07:49.420 --> 0:07:52.336
What was he like?
Big tipper?

0:07:52.467 --> 0:07:54.730
I guess.

0:07:54.860 --> 0:07:56.732
Mm.Oh. You know what?
You stay comfy.

0:07:56.862 --> 0:08:00.039
I will rescue
this beautiful creation.

0:08:01.171 --> 0:08:02.955
Look at that.

0:08:05.088 --> 0:08:06.350
Ta-da!

0:08:06.481 --> 0:08:08.352
Gene's staying for dinner.

0:08:23.715 --> 0:08:25.369
Dude, what the fuck?!

0:08:25.500 --> 0:08:27.042
I know it's awkward, right?

0:08:27.066 --> 0:08:29.634
But you don't have to
call me "dad." Yet.

0:08:29.765 --> 0:08:32.115
I dunno what this is about...
But all I have to do

0:08:32.245 --> 0:08:34.813
is pick up the phone
and it's bye-bye, Saul Goodman.

0:08:34.944 --> 0:08:37.139
Yeah, but you haven't picked up
the phone yet, have you?

0:08:37.163 --> 0:08:39.165
Or tried to strong-arm me
for cash.

0:08:39.296 --> 0:08:41.559
And guess what?
I know why.

0:08:41.690 --> 0:08:44.910
Because reward money,
blackmail...

0:08:45.041 --> 0:08:46.366
That's not gonna
tickle your pickle.

0:08:46.390 --> 0:08:48.348
I know what you really want.

0:08:48.479 --> 0:08:51.700
Oh, yeah?
What's that?

0:08:51.830 --> 0:08:53.919
You want in the game.

0:08:54.050 --> 0:08:57.662
"The game"?
W-What... What game?

0:08:57.706 --> 0:08:59.446
The game.

0:08:59.577 --> 0:09:01.623
The one you've been watching
your entire life.

0:09:01.753 --> 0:09:04.016
You got your nose pressed up
against the glass,

0:09:04.147 --> 0:09:05.975
peerin' in
while the big boys play.

0:09:06.105 --> 0:09:07.454
Man, speak English.

0:09:07.585 --> 0:09:08.910
What the hell
are you talking about?

0:09:08.934 --> 0:09:10.022
The game.

0:09:10.153 --> 0:09:11.458
It's right there...

0:09:11.589 --> 0:09:15.027
You can see it,
but you can't touch it.

0:09:15.158 --> 0:09:19.858
The cars, the clothes, the cash.

0:09:19.989 --> 0:09:22.469
The ladies.

0:09:22.600 --> 0:09:24.994
It's about knowing
all the angles, you know,

0:09:25.124 --> 0:09:28.345
putting it all on the line
and winning big.

0:09:28.475 --> 0:09:30.826
But here you are, Jeffie.

0:09:30.956 --> 0:09:33.611
Standing outside
with the suckers.

0:09:33.742 --> 0:09:36.396
Tryin' to pay off that cab,
sweatin' the bills,

0:09:36.527 --> 0:09:37.963
gettin' older.

0:09:38.094 --> 0:09:41.924
It's so close, but, damn it,
you just can't get in.

0:09:42.054 --> 0:09:44.143
Until now.

0:09:44.274 --> 0:09:46.319
I can make it happen.

0:09:50.802 --> 0:09:53.152
You?

0:09:53.283 --> 0:09:55.415
Saul Goodman.

0:09:58.331 --> 0:09:59.855
So, here's the deal.

0:09:59.985 --> 0:10:01.639
I will show you the game.

0:10:01.770 --> 0:10:03.772
And then we're done.

0:10:31.190 --> 0:10:32.583
Two days.

0:10:32.627 --> 0:10:34.280
Caller thinks
it's brother-in-law

0:10:34.324 --> 0:10:36.282
with history of violence.

0:10:36.326 --> 0:10:37.544
10-4.

0:10:47.250 --> 0:10:49.208
Noise complaint.
50 or so teens.

0:10:49.252 --> 0:10:50.819
Parents possibly out of town.

0:10:50.862 --> 0:10:52.462
Neighbors say
this is not the first time.

0:10:53.822 --> 0:10:56.128
Man #3:10-20?

0:10:56.172 --> 0:10:58.435
37882 Crestview.

0:10:59.654 --> 0:11:01.960
Headed that way.

0:11:02.004 --> 0:11:04.702
Missing juvenile.
Caucasian male.

0:11:04.746 --> 0:11:07.836
6'2", 240 pounds.

0:11:07.879 --> 0:11:11.448
Last seen at gas station
on Kerrywood and Western.

0:11:29.248 --> 0:11:32.643
Parents called?

0:11:32.687 --> 0:11:35.690
Got ahold of Mom.
ETA is 20 minutes.

0:11:45.612 --> 0:11:47.310
Woman #4:10-23.

0:12:31.310 --> 0:12:32.311
G'night, ladies.

0:12:32.442 --> 0:12:33.791
See ya, Gene.Bye.

0:12:33.922 --> 0:12:35.532
Yeah.

0:14:10.409 --> 0:14:11.584
There a problem?

0:14:11.715 --> 0:14:13.412
No, I...
I just came to say thanks.

0:14:13.543 --> 0:14:14.587
Um, I'm Gene.

0:14:14.718 --> 0:14:16.024
From Cinnabon.

0:14:16.154 --> 0:14:18.113
Uh, you called the EMTs for me

0:14:18.243 --> 0:14:21.420
when I... fainted.

0:14:21.551 --> 0:14:23.292
Yeah.
I remember you.

0:14:23.422 --> 0:14:24.728
"Get a lawyer!"

0:14:24.859 --> 0:14:28.036
Nick!
Do I detect Cinnabons?

0:14:28.166 --> 0:14:29.472
Yeah!

0:14:29.602 --> 0:14:31.648
Well, Christ almighty,
get him in here.

0:14:34.477 --> 0:14:36.958
I'm sorry about
the lawyer thing.

0:14:37.088 --> 0:14:38.655
Just slipped out.

0:14:42.093 --> 0:14:43.660
It's a free country.

0:14:55.628 --> 0:14:58.153
Hi.
Uh, Gene Takavic.

0:14:58.283 --> 0:14:59.589
Uh...

0:14:59.719 --> 0:15:02.418
Hey, Gene. I'm Frank.
This is Nick.

0:15:02.548 --> 0:15:05.638
Yeah. Nick here, um,
did me a solid,

0:15:05.769 --> 0:15:07.336
so, uh...

0:15:07.466 --> 0:15:09.425
Well...

0:15:15.474 --> 0:15:18.738
Please...
Enjoy yourselves.

0:15:18.869 --> 0:15:20.479
Well, God bless ya.

0:15:20.610 --> 0:15:21.741
Well, 9:45.

0:15:21.872 --> 0:15:23.152
Nick, you wanna
grab yours to-go?

0:15:23.265 --> 0:15:25.920
Sure.Yeah.
He's gotta check the lot.

0:15:26.050 --> 0:15:27.922
Yeah.

0:15:28.052 --> 0:15:30.315
Thanks.

0:15:30.446 --> 0:15:32.013
Uh...

0:15:32.143 --> 0:15:33.623
You want to take a load off?

0:15:33.753 --> 0:15:36.756
Grab yourself a cup of coffee
if you'd like.

0:15:36.887 --> 0:15:37.757
Yeah.
Yeah?

0:15:37.888 --> 0:15:40.064
Oh.
Okay.

0:15:40.195 --> 0:15:42.066
Ohh.

0:15:43.589 --> 0:15:47.158
I should not be doing this.

0:15:54.383 --> 0:15:57.125
Hey, do me a favor,

0:15:57.255 --> 0:16:00.345
if you were ever to cross paths
with my wife, shh.

0:16:00.476 --> 0:16:01.564
Oh.

0:16:01.694 --> 0:16:04.393
Scout's honor.

0:16:04.523 --> 0:16:07.439
Ahh.
Oh, man.

0:16:07.570 --> 0:16:11.356
I haven't had one of these
in forever.

0:16:11.487 --> 0:16:13.619
Watching my waistline.

0:16:13.750 --> 0:16:16.405
Yeah, but every now
and then... No harm, right?

0:16:18.929 --> 0:16:21.540
Oh, wow.

0:16:23.107 --> 0:16:24.761
Mmm.

0:16:36.294 --> 0:16:39.776
Mmm.
Mm-mm-mmm-mmm-mmm.

0:16:42.866 --> 0:16:45.042
So, did you catch the game
last night?

0:16:46.783 --> 0:16:48.828
The game?

0:16:48.959 --> 0:16:52.658
What the hell is wrong
with those guys?

0:16:52.789 --> 0:16:54.834
I can't even talk about it.

0:16:54.965 --> 0:16:56.271
Mm.

0:16:56.401 --> 0:16:59.274
Really thought
this was the year.

0:16:59.404 --> 0:17:00.623
Yeah, me too.

0:17:00.753 --> 0:17:02.059
Mm.

0:17:02.190 --> 0:17:05.236
You know,
Texas wasn't even ranked.

0:17:05.367 --> 0:17:07.543
I know.

0:17:07.673 --> 0:17:09.849
Play-calling was crazy.

0:17:09.980 --> 0:17:11.199
The worst.

0:17:11.329 --> 0:17:15.159
Three downs to make
a foot and a half?

0:17:15.290 --> 0:17:17.640
How hard can it be?

0:17:17.770 --> 0:17:21.383
Well, you can't win
when Martinez plays like that.

0:17:21.513 --> 0:17:22.819
Martinez.

0:17:22.949 --> 0:17:25.865
I mean, what's up with him?

0:17:25.996 --> 0:17:28.216
You think something's off?

0:17:28.346 --> 0:17:30.261
Maybe.

0:17:30.392 --> 0:17:32.220
Mm.

0:17:32.350 --> 0:17:34.439
Next week, Oklahoma State.

0:17:34.570 --> 0:17:36.920
The Okies.
Huh?

0:17:37.051 --> 0:17:38.443
Uh, that's what we called them.

0:17:38.574 --> 0:17:42.143
You ever done the drive?
Topeka, Wichita... Nice.

0:17:42.186 --> 0:17:44.058
Well, then you haven't done it.

0:17:44.188 --> 0:17:45.494
Can't beat Memorial.

0:17:45.624 --> 0:17:46.624
Damn straight.

0:17:46.669 --> 0:17:47.539
What do you love most?

0:17:47.670 --> 0:17:49.150
Now, that's a tough one.

0:17:49.280 --> 0:17:50.649
You think Weedon'll come through
on his home turf?

0:17:50.673 --> 0:17:52.066
Yeah.
No way!

0:17:52.196 --> 0:17:53.850
With that thumb? Thumb's a dealbreaker.

0:17:53.980 --> 0:17:56.157
I'll tell you something.

0:17:56.287 --> 0:17:59.595
The Cougar helmet
was the thumb-breaker.

0:18:02.032 --> 0:18:04.034
Mmm.
Mm-mm-mmm.

0:18:04.165 --> 0:18:05.862
Delicious.

0:18:05.992 --> 0:18:07.559
Mmm!

0:18:11.128 --> 0:18:13.739
Welp, I should probably
be heading back.

0:18:13.870 --> 0:18:15.263
Well, thanks again.

0:18:15.393 --> 0:18:16.593
Oh, it's the least I could do.

0:18:16.655 --> 0:18:17.655
Have a good one.

0:18:17.700 --> 0:18:19.354
Come back anytime.

0:19:10.361 --> 0:19:12.711
Have a good night,
Gene. Goodnight, Krista.

0:19:12.842 --> 0:19:14.322
Goodnight.Goodnight.

0:19:54.536 --> 0:19:55.667
Frank?

0:19:55.798 --> 0:19:58.017
Gene, Gene,
the Cinnabon machine.

0:19:58.148 --> 0:20:00.455
I could smell ya
coming up the hallway.

0:20:00.585 --> 0:20:02.239
Oh, I get that all the time.

0:20:02.370 --> 0:20:03.980
Here you go, guys.

0:20:04.110 --> 0:20:05.373
Hey, can I...

0:20:05.503 --> 0:20:07.679
Hey, Gene, don't even ask.
Grab a coffee.

0:20:07.810 --> 0:20:09.464
That was one hell
of a game, huh?

0:20:09.594 --> 0:20:11.030
What were you thinking
at halftime?

0:20:11.161 --> 0:20:13.642
Well, uh, I was thinking,

0:20:13.772 --> 0:20:16.384
"Hey, this could, uh...

0:20:16.514 --> 0:20:18.342
This could be a long one."

0:20:18.473 --> 0:20:20.538
And I tell you, you know who
I'm not bitching about today?

0:20:20.562 --> 0:20:23.260
Pelini. Nah.Pelini. That's...
Yeah, the coach.

0:20:23.391 --> 0:20:24.977
You know me.
I go at him when things are bad,

0:20:25.001 --> 0:20:27.177
but when he does something good,
I'm all about it.

0:20:45.064 --> 0:20:46.588
Goodnight, Gene. Goodnight!

0:21:05.259 --> 0:21:06.738
They got him in there
for a reason.

0:21:06.869 --> 0:21:09.263
Mm-mmm-mmm.
Mmm.

0:21:58.834 --> 0:22:00.488
I still got it.

0:22:12.064 --> 0:22:14.763
Mm-mm-mm-mmm-mmm.

0:22:39.353 --> 0:22:40.615
Can I help you, sir?

0:22:40.745 --> 0:22:41.790
Oh, yeah.

0:22:41.920 --> 0:22:42.965
Uh, no thanks.

0:22:43.095 --> 0:22:44.793
I'm just browsing.

0:22:44.923 --> 0:22:46.577
Okay. Yeah.

0:22:56.674 --> 0:23:01.157
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9...

0:23:04.682 --> 0:23:06.423
14...

0:23:08.556 --> 0:23:12.516
15, 17, 18.

0:23:18.566 --> 0:23:21.395
6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

0:24:05.700 --> 0:24:08.833
2...

0:24:08.964 --> 0:24:11.662
11, 12, 13,

0:24:11.793 --> 0:24:14.317
14, 15.

0:24:14.448 --> 0:24:16.537
Alright. Aaand...

0:24:16.667 --> 0:24:17.842
17 feet.

0:24:17.973 --> 0:24:18.973
Right here.

0:24:28.157 --> 0:24:29.288
Ribbon it off.

0:24:29.419 --> 0:24:30.289
Come on.

0:24:30.420 --> 0:24:32.248
All the way, guys.

0:24:37.427 --> 0:24:38.950
Okay.

0:24:38.994 --> 0:24:41.126
Check, check, one, two.
One, two.

0:24:41.170 --> 0:24:42.780
Alright, let's move.

0:24:42.824 --> 0:24:45.522
Starting position.
Right down there.

0:24:48.482 --> 0:24:50.048
Alright, we ready?

0:24:50.092 --> 0:24:52.224
And grab your bag!

0:24:52.268 --> 0:24:54.313
And go!

0:24:54.357 --> 0:24:56.446
That's it!
Move! Move!

0:24:56.490 --> 0:24:58.274
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go!

0:24:58.317 --> 0:25:00.363
One!
Armani suits and run!

0:25:01.669 --> 0:25:04.280
Two!
Air Jordan shoes for you!

0:25:07.457 --> 0:25:10.286
Three!
Linen shirts for free!

0:25:13.289 --> 0:25:16.814
Four!
Cashmere sweaters out the door!

0:25:16.858 --> 0:25:19.382
Five!
Patagonias to survive!

0:25:21.036 --> 0:25:23.865
Six!
Swanky sweatsuits in the mix!

0:25:23.908 --> 0:25:26.128
Halt!
Ohh. What?

0:25:26.258 --> 0:25:27.259
Too many.

0:25:27.390 --> 0:25:28.696
You gotta be precise.

0:25:28.826 --> 0:25:30.088
Just three of each.

0:25:30.219 --> 0:25:31.699
Why?

0:25:31.829 --> 0:25:33.701
And why do I gotta run
around like an asshole?

0:25:33.831 --> 0:25:34.919
I already told you.

0:25:35.050 --> 0:25:36.225
Three minutes.

0:25:36.355 --> 0:25:37.705
Got it?
That's our window.

0:25:37.835 --> 0:25:40.664
Yeah, but why three minutes?

0:25:40.795 --> 0:25:43.058
Because at three minutes,
that's when security sees you

0:25:43.188 --> 0:25:46.409
on the cameras and the cops haul
your ass to jail, alright?

0:25:46.540 --> 0:25:48.803
So let's go. Wait...
there's cameras?

0:25:48.933 --> 0:25:50.631
Sure, there's cameras!

0:25:50.761 --> 0:25:53.155
They erase the tapes
every 72 hours.

0:25:53.285 --> 0:25:55.287
So that's why you only
take three of each.

0:25:55.418 --> 0:25:57.289
And only the pricey stuff.

0:25:57.420 --> 0:25:58.900
When the store opens
the next morning,

0:25:58.987 --> 0:26:00.554
they won't even know
they were robbed.

0:26:00.684 --> 0:26:03.600
By the time they do inventory,
abracadabra!

0:26:03.731 --> 0:26:05.950
No more Jeffie on the tape,
right?

0:26:06.081 --> 0:26:09.737
So, three items, three minutes.

0:26:09.867 --> 0:26:10.955
It's easy.

0:26:11.086 --> 0:26:13.044
Let's go.

0:26:13.175 --> 0:26:14.176
How many of each?

0:26:14.306 --> 0:26:15.569
Three.

0:26:15.699 --> 0:26:17.962
Pigs get fat,
hogs get slaughtered.

0:26:18.093 --> 0:26:19.355
I dunno...

0:26:21.792 --> 0:26:23.359
What don't you know?

0:26:24.969 --> 0:26:27.189
It's just, this whole thing...
It seems crazy.

0:26:27.319 --> 0:26:28.320
Is this too hot for you?

0:26:28.451 --> 0:26:29.670
You know, just say so.

0:26:29.800 --> 0:26:31.802
You know what?
Screw it.

0:26:31.933 --> 0:26:33.282
"Crazy"?

0:26:33.412 --> 0:26:34.849
I'll tell you what's crazy.

0:26:34.979 --> 0:26:37.112
Fifty-year-old
high school chemistry teacher

0:26:37.242 --> 0:26:38.853
comes into my office.

0:26:38.983 --> 0:26:42.247
The guy is so broke,
he can't pay his own mortgage.

0:26:42.378 --> 0:26:44.249
One year later,
he's got a pile of cash

0:26:44.380 --> 0:26:46.164
as big as a Volkswagen.

0:26:46.295 --> 0:26:48.993
That's crazy.

0:26:49.124 --> 0:26:51.126
I'll do it.

0:26:51.256 --> 0:26:53.563
This sounds good to you?

0:26:55.521 --> 0:26:57.175
I think it'll work.

0:26:57.306 --> 0:26:58.568
Well, look at you.

0:26:58.699 --> 0:27:00.091
You're young.

0:27:00.222 --> 0:27:02.441
You're probably, uh,
fast on the feet, huh?

0:27:02.572 --> 0:27:04.748
Okay, I-I didn't say
I wouldn't do it.

0:27:04.879 --> 0:27:09.405
I just had some questions
about, like, logistics.

0:27:11.059 --> 0:27:12.756
Are you in or out?

0:27:17.935 --> 0:27:18.980
In.

0:27:19.110 --> 0:27:20.851
Okay.

0:27:20.982 --> 0:27:23.549
Back to one.

0:27:23.593 --> 0:27:25.726
Check, test, one, two, one, two.

0:27:25.769 --> 0:27:29.381
Okay, and ready, set, action!

0:27:29.425 --> 0:27:31.645
Move! Move! Move!

0:27:31.688 --> 0:27:33.777
Pick up the pace!
Go! Go! Go!

0:27:33.821 --> 0:27:36.606
One!
Armani suits and run!

0:27:36.650 --> 0:27:38.434
Two!
Air Jordan shoes for you!

0:27:38.477 --> 0:27:41.176
Three!
Linen shirts for free!

0:27:41.219 --> 0:27:43.569
Four!
Cashmere sweaters out the door!

0:27:43.613 --> 0:27:45.920
Five!
Patagonias to survive!

0:27:45.963 --> 0:27:48.270
Six!
Swanky sweatsuits in the mix!

0:27:48.313 --> 0:27:49.445
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go!

0:28:08.551 --> 0:28:10.553
Barbara?
Yes?

0:28:10.684 --> 0:28:13.469
Let's ask maintenance
to give this area a polish.

0:28:13.599 --> 0:28:15.123
Got it, I'll call now.

0:28:15.253 --> 0:28:17.473
Thanks.

0:28:17.603 --> 0:28:19.518
Okay, then.
Have a good night.

0:28:19.649 --> 0:28:20.519
You too.

0:28:20.650 --> 0:28:22.217
Excuse me, ma'am?

0:28:22.347 --> 0:28:24.349
There's a delivery.

0:28:24.480 --> 0:28:26.134
A delivery?

0:28:29.441 --> 0:28:30.921
No.

0:28:31.052 --> 0:28:31.879
No, no.

0:28:32.009 --> 0:28:34.403
Stop.

0:28:34.533 --> 0:28:36.579
You are not leaving that thing
on my loading dock.

0:28:36.710 --> 0:28:37.972
No way.

0:28:39.930 --> 0:28:43.325
Fourteen twelve
Cottonwood Drive...

0:28:43.455 --> 0:28:45.109
Dock... Dock D.

0:28:45.240 --> 0:28:46.676
Let me see.

0:28:49.679 --> 0:28:52.160
Two-stroke engine sprayer pumps?

0:28:52.290 --> 0:28:53.683
This is a department store.

0:28:53.814 --> 0:28:56.338
Does it look like
we use sprayer pumps here?

0:28:56.468 --> 0:28:58.906
Well, we don't.

0:28:59.036 --> 0:29:01.430
I was given this address, ma'am.

0:29:01.560 --> 0:29:03.998
I need to talk
to your supervisor.

0:29:04.128 --> 0:29:06.522
Got it.
You stay right here.

0:29:26.063 --> 0:29:28.544
Dispatch. Steve.

0:29:28.587 --> 0:29:30.024
Yes... this is Kathy Deutsch,

0:29:30.067 --> 0:29:32.504
I'm the manager
of a Lancaster's in Omaha.

0:29:32.548 --> 0:29:33.743
And you guys
just delivered something

0:29:33.767 --> 0:29:36.117
that we did not order.
Really?

0:29:36.247 --> 0:29:39.685
Your guy brought a giant wooden
crate onto my loading dock,

0:29:39.816 --> 0:29:43.037
seems to be some kind
of spraying system.

0:29:43.167 --> 0:29:47.606
The invoice number
is 1-9-6-8-AE35.

0:29:47.737 --> 0:29:50.435
Okay, just, uh, give me a second
to catch up here.

0:29:50.566 --> 0:29:52.742
Uh...
Uh, sprayer pump.

0:29:52.873 --> 0:29:54.004
Yeah, I think I got it.

0:29:54.135 --> 0:29:55.832
Omaha, right?

0:29:55.876 --> 0:29:57.791
Yes, but I run
a department store.

0:29:57.834 --> 0:29:59.705
We don't sell anything
like that.

0:29:59.749 --> 0:30:01.620
Clearly this is a mistake
you need to fix.

0:30:01.751 --> 0:30:04.275
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

0:30:04.406 --> 0:30:07.104
My boss is gonna just...

0:30:07.235 --> 0:30:09.063
Ah, great.

0:30:09.106 --> 0:30:10.847
Ricky's booked solid.

0:30:10.978 --> 0:30:11.935
Ricky?

0:30:11.979 --> 0:30:13.589
He's the driver.

0:30:16.505 --> 0:30:19.595
Well, Ricky's just gonna have
to put the box back on the truck.

0:30:19.638 --> 0:30:21.727
Uh, little problem with that.

0:30:21.771 --> 0:30:23.077
Cargo space.

0:30:23.207 --> 0:30:25.296
He's got a pickup
at the airport in an hour.

0:30:25.427 --> 0:30:27.124
It's a messy one, too.

0:30:27.255 --> 0:30:30.867
It's, uh, nine hundred pounds
of Spanish mackerel.

0:30:30.998 --> 0:30:33.827
Okay. I'm sorry,
but that's not my problem.

0:30:33.870 --> 0:30:35.524
No, I know.
It's just... Wow.

0:30:35.654 --> 0:30:38.527
I mean, if he's late,
that's gonna stink.

0:30:38.657 --> 0:30:40.659
Pun intended.

0:30:40.790 --> 0:30:42.836
Gene?
Everything okay?

0:30:42.966 --> 0:30:45.795
Yep. Oh, I'm just, uh,
putting out fires.

0:30:45.926 --> 0:30:47.405
It's a delivery issue.

0:30:47.536 --> 0:30:48.276
Don't worry.Okay.

0:30:48.406 --> 0:30:50.060
I got it.

0:30:50.191 --> 0:30:52.062
Sorry.

0:30:52.106 --> 0:30:53.934
- You still there?
- Yes.

0:30:54.064 --> 0:30:56.545
Look, I don't know what to
tell you about your fish issue,

0:30:56.675 --> 0:30:58.982
it's just I can't have
a huge box just...

0:30:59.026 --> 0:31:00.462
I-I understand.

0:31:00.505 --> 0:31:01.743
It's just... I mean,
we both have people

0:31:01.767 --> 0:31:05.249
we have to answer to, right?

0:31:05.380 --> 0:31:06.772
Hey, I've got an idea.

0:31:06.816 --> 0:31:08.426
Um, I've got an extra truck.

0:31:08.470 --> 0:31:10.124
I could drive over there myself.

0:31:10.254 --> 0:31:12.996
Great.
How long till you get here?

0:31:13.040 --> 0:31:15.390
Well, I'm just over
in Urbandale.

0:31:15.433 --> 0:31:19.046
Um, so, if I leave right now,
be there in four hours.

0:31:19.176 --> 0:31:21.265
Four hours?
No.

0:31:21.309 --> 0:31:23.137
No, no, it's fine.
I don't mind the drive.

0:31:23.267 --> 0:31:25.067
I'll crank the tunes,
it'll be like old times.

0:31:25.095 --> 0:31:28.142
I mean, no, I can't wait
around that long.

0:31:28.185 --> 0:31:31.275
We're closing
for the night here.

0:31:31.406 --> 0:31:33.016
Oh. Whew.

0:31:37.803 --> 0:31:39.196
How's this?

0:31:39.240 --> 0:31:40.502
Yeah?

0:31:40.632 --> 0:31:43.505
If you promise me that...

0:31:43.635 --> 0:31:48.336
Ricky will get back here
by 10:00 a.m. tomorrow...

0:31:48.466 --> 0:31:50.294
I'll hold the box overnight.

0:31:50.338 --> 0:31:51.774
You would do that?

0:31:51.905 --> 0:31:53.907
Oh, my God.
You're a lifesaver.

0:31:54.037 --> 0:31:55.299
What's your name again?

0:31:55.343 --> 0:31:57.084
Kathy.
Kathy.

0:31:57.214 --> 0:32:00.261
Yeah, my guy'll be there,
10:00 a.m. on the dot.

0:32:00.304 --> 0:32:01.915
With flowers.

0:32:02.045 --> 0:32:04.569
Well, f-flowers
won't be necessary...

0:32:04.700 --> 0:32:06.267
but thanks for the thought.

0:32:06.310 --> 0:32:09.487
No, thank you.

0:32:45.697 --> 0:32:47.221
G'night, ladies.

0:32:47.351 --> 0:32:49.092
'Night.
Good night, Gene.

0:33:13.377 --> 0:33:14.422
Gentlemen. Hey, Gene.

0:33:14.552 --> 0:33:16.641
Heya, Gene.

0:33:16.772 --> 0:33:18.600
Well, better hit it.

0:33:18.730 --> 0:33:21.255
Good luck to Lizzie
on that spelling bee.

0:33:21.385 --> 0:33:22.256
She's a little nervous.

0:33:22.386 --> 0:33:23.822
Nah, she's gonna be great.

0:33:23.953 --> 0:33:26.260
Yeah. Hey,
Huskers are back.

0:33:26.390 --> 0:33:27.826
Ohh.

0:33:27.957 --> 0:33:29.326
Probably heard me screaming
all the way in Lincoln.

0:33:29.350 --> 0:33:31.656
I was hoarse.

0:33:31.787 --> 0:33:33.963
Uh, and Martinez... ahh.

0:33:34.094 --> 0:33:36.879
484 yards?
That's a freshman record!

0:33:37.010 --> 0:33:38.054
Wow.
You know what?

0:33:38.185 --> 0:33:39.534
I love that kid.

0:33:39.664 --> 0:33:42.015
Hey, if he and Kinnie
keep it up,

0:33:42.145 --> 0:33:43.494
I think they still got a shot.

0:33:43.625 --> 0:33:45.975
Ohh.
Your lips to God's ears.

0:33:47.672 --> 0:33:49.022
Ahh. Okay.

0:33:50.893 --> 0:33:51.894
Wow.

0:33:52.025 --> 0:33:54.766
Mmm.

0:33:54.897 --> 0:33:56.290
Mm-mm-mmm.

0:34:00.424 --> 0:34:02.296
Hm-hmm.

0:34:02.426 --> 0:34:04.037
Mm-mm-mmm.

0:34:04.167 --> 0:34:05.690
Hello, gorgeous.

0:34:09.738 --> 0:34:11.305
Mmm.

0:34:46.470 --> 0:34:49.647
One, Armani suits and run.

0:34:49.778 --> 0:34:52.128
Armani, Armani, Armani.

0:34:52.259 --> 0:34:53.434
Armani.

0:34:53.564 --> 0:34:54.564
Armani?

0:34:54.609 --> 0:34:56.089
Armani.

0:35:02.007 --> 0:35:05.098
Two, Air Jordan shoes for you.

0:35:08.840 --> 0:35:10.451
Alright.

0:35:17.632 --> 0:35:20.504
Three, linen shirts for free.

0:35:20.635 --> 0:35:23.551
One, two, three.

0:35:23.681 --> 0:35:25.988
Four, cashmere sweaters
out the door.

0:35:26.119 --> 0:35:29.513
No.
Yes, yes, yes.

0:35:29.644 --> 0:35:32.299
One, two, three.

0:35:32.429 --> 0:35:36.694
Five, Patagonias to survive.

0:35:40.133 --> 0:35:41.525
6,000 more seats.

0:35:41.656 --> 0:35:43.832
6,000 more fans.

0:35:43.962 --> 0:35:46.574
I don't know.
All those luxury suites?

0:35:46.704 --> 0:35:48.880
Start saving now.
Hm.

0:35:49.011 --> 0:35:50.839
Mm, you see that interview
with Pelini?

0:35:50.969 --> 0:35:52.580
The guy's feeling his oats.

0:35:52.710 --> 0:35:54.321
He can taste it now.

0:35:54.451 --> 0:35:56.584
You think he'll ever get outta
Osborne's shadow?

0:35:56.714 --> 0:35:58.716
Mm.
Osborne... what a career.

0:35:58.847 --> 0:36:00.327
Wow.

0:36:00.370 --> 0:36:02.894
I mean, a hall of famer
and a congressman?

0:36:03.025 --> 0:36:04.461
Mm.
Unbelievable.

0:36:04.592 --> 0:36:07.116
Seven, spendy dresses
sent from heaven.

0:36:12.643 --> 0:36:13.905
Mm-mm-mmm.

0:36:14.036 --> 0:36:15.907
'95 team?

0:36:16.038 --> 0:36:17.996
Wow.
What a line up.

0:36:18.127 --> 0:36:19.998
I mean,
the "I formation."

0:36:20.129 --> 0:36:22.914
Well, I'll tell ya, Pelini could
have taken a page outta that book.

0:36:23.045 --> 0:36:24.960
Nine, pricey lingerie is mine.

0:36:27.310 --> 0:36:30.444
Ten, calfskin briefcases
for men.

0:36:30.574 --> 0:36:32.446
Apples and oranges, my friend.

0:36:32.576 --> 0:36:33.838
Aw.
Oh, come on.

0:36:33.969 --> 0:36:35.666
Osborne had the great
Tommie Frazier.

0:36:35.797 --> 0:36:37.035
Frazier! Yeah, say it with me.
Frazier. Yeah, sure, sure.

0:36:37.059 --> 0:36:39.061
Huh? Say it with me.

0:36:39.192 --> 0:36:42.630
Twelve, luxury pumps
to un-shelve.

0:36:42.760 --> 0:36:45.198
How about that 44-21 win
against the Buffs?

0:36:45.328 --> 0:36:47.635
Ahh.
Be still my heart.

0:36:47.765 --> 0:36:49.289
Mmm.

0:36:49.419 --> 0:36:52.727
Seventy-six yard pass
to Reggie Baul and...

0:36:52.857 --> 0:36:54.076
And never sacked once.

0:36:54.207 --> 0:36:56.992
Wow. You have got
quite a memory.

0:36:59.168 --> 0:37:01.126
Yeah, well, uh,
I'll tell you what.

0:37:01.257 --> 0:37:03.041
I can remember every stitch
of clothing

0:37:03.172 --> 0:37:04.695
I was wearing during that game,

0:37:04.826 --> 0:37:06.506
but ask me what I had
for dinner last night

0:37:06.610 --> 0:37:08.090
and clean slate.

0:37:08.221 --> 0:37:09.831
Yeah.
Tell me about it.

0:37:11.963 --> 0:37:13.574
Mm.

0:37:19.319 --> 0:37:21.035
Well, I tell ya, if you're
not passing the ball,

0:37:21.059 --> 0:37:23.236
that's what's gonna happen.

0:37:23.366 --> 0:37:24.366
Mmm.

0:37:24.411 --> 0:37:26.935
Eighteen, Kate Spade's queen.

0:37:29.024 --> 0:37:32.767
Nineteen, Calvin leathers
on the scene.

0:37:32.897 --> 0:37:34.943
Twenty, Uggs look funny.

0:37:38.251 --> 0:37:41.515
Sure looks pretty, Huskers red
against that green.

0:37:41.645 --> 0:37:43.299
It's like Christmas out there.

0:37:49.479 --> 0:37:51.438
Ahh! Ugh!

0:37:53.744 --> 0:37:54.919
You okay?

0:37:55.050 --> 0:37:57.879
Mm-hmm.
Wrong pipe.

0:37:58.009 --> 0:38:00.577
Oh.
Oh, okay.

0:38:00.708 --> 0:38:03.537
Mmm. Ohh.

0:38:03.667 --> 0:38:05.713
So, you think our guys
are gonna move to the Big Ten

0:38:05.843 --> 0:38:08.542
like they're saying?

0:38:08.672 --> 0:38:09.978
Big Ten?

0:38:10.108 --> 0:38:11.428
Yeah. I mean,
they're just chasing

0:38:11.545 --> 0:38:13.460
the, you know, mighty dollar,
if you ask me.

0:38:13.590 --> 0:38:16.419
I mean, both powerhouses,
'course.

0:38:16.550 --> 0:38:20.989
But, you know, you got
Oklahoma and Texas over here.

0:38:21.119 --> 0:38:26.342
But Michigan,
Ohio State over there.

0:38:26.473 --> 0:38:29.563
I-I don't know.

0:38:29.693 --> 0:38:32.261
Guess I like tradition.

0:38:32.392 --> 0:38:36.352
Mmm.
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mmm-mmm!

0:38:36.483 --> 0:38:37.788
So good.

0:38:37.919 --> 0:38:39.834
That center.
Mm.

0:38:39.964 --> 0:38:41.488
Just amazing.

0:38:41.618 --> 0:38:43.272
Mm-mm-mmm.

0:38:43.403 --> 0:38:44.752
Wow. Mmm.

0:38:44.882 --> 0:38:46.928
Oh, God.

0:38:47.058 --> 0:38:49.365
What am I doing?

0:38:49.496 --> 0:38:51.280
What?

0:38:51.411 --> 0:38:53.761
Look at me!
I don't know.

0:38:53.891 --> 0:38:56.285
I-I don't know.

0:38:56.416 --> 0:38:57.547
Oh, Jesus.

0:38:57.678 --> 0:38:58.678
Gene?

0:39:00.898 --> 0:39:03.118
Oh, God.

0:39:03.248 --> 0:39:04.815
You...

0:39:07.078 --> 0:39:09.516
You have a wife, right, Frank?

0:39:09.646 --> 0:39:10.517
Well, yeah.
Yeah?

0:39:10.647 --> 0:39:11.866
Yeah.

0:39:11.996 --> 0:39:14.738
And she's waiting for you.

0:39:14.869 --> 0:39:17.001
Look at me.

0:39:17.132 --> 0:39:19.134
I got...

0:39:19.264 --> 0:39:22.790
I got no one.

0:39:22.920 --> 0:39:24.922
My parents are dead.

0:39:25.053 --> 0:39:26.533
Oh.

0:39:26.663 --> 0:39:28.143
My brother...

0:39:34.105 --> 0:39:36.804
My brother is dead.

0:39:36.934 --> 0:39:38.849
I, uh...

0:39:42.549 --> 0:39:45.639
I got no wife...

0:39:45.769 --> 0:39:47.554
No kids.

0:39:47.684 --> 0:39:49.817
No friends.

0:39:49.947 --> 0:39:52.820
If I died tonight...

0:39:52.950 --> 0:39:55.213
no one would care.

0:39:55.344 --> 0:39:56.824
What difference would it make?

0:39:56.954 --> 0:39:59.043
Gene, buddy...

0:39:59.174 --> 0:40:04.222
No, I-I-I'm sure that you mean
a lot to, you know...

0:40:04.353 --> 0:40:05.876
To a lot of... lots of people.

0:40:06.007 --> 0:40:11.055
If I died tonight, my landlord
would pack up my stuff.

0:40:11.186 --> 0:40:14.319
It'd take him three hours.

0:40:14.450 --> 0:40:18.454
And Cinnabon would just
hire a new manager.

0:40:18.585 --> 0:40:19.716
Gene who?

0:40:19.847 --> 0:40:21.022
Poof!

0:40:21.152 --> 0:40:24.547
I'd be gone.
I'd be...

0:40:24.678 --> 0:40:26.810
a...

0:40:26.941 --> 0:40:28.725
a ghost.

0:40:28.856 --> 0:40:33.991
Less than a ghost.
I'd be a... a sha... shadow.

0:40:36.341 --> 0:40:38.256
I'd just be...

0:40:38.387 --> 0:40:39.997
nothing.

0:40:44.219 --> 0:40:48.136
I mean, Frank...
What's the point, Frank?

0:40:54.011 --> 0:40:55.970
What's the poi...

0:41:11.202 --> 0:41:14.118
Ah.

0:41:14.249 --> 0:41:16.381
Oh, you... I'm so sorry.

0:41:16.512 --> 0:41:17.948
You didn't need to hear
any of that.

0:41:18.079 --> 0:41:20.168
No, no, no, no, no,
that's... that's okay.

0:41:20.298 --> 0:41:21.909
No, that... that is okay.

0:41:24.128 --> 0:41:26.043
Everybody has bad days.

0:41:26.174 --> 0:41:27.741
You've felt like this?

0:41:30.265 --> 0:41:33.964
No, I mean, not me...
But people.

0:41:34.095 --> 0:41:35.792
I-I think a lot of people.

0:41:35.923 --> 0:41:39.709
Yeah, I mean, i-it's just like
life's ups and life's downs.

0:41:39.840 --> 0:41:42.538
Yeah.

0:41:42.669 --> 0:41:44.453
Hey, you're not gonna tell
Nick, are you?

0:41:44.584 --> 0:41:45.933
Oh.

0:41:46.063 --> 0:41:48.413
No, 'course not.

0:41:48.544 --> 0:41:50.981
Well... thanks so much
for listening.

0:41:51.112 --> 0:41:53.636
Yeah, no, no.
No p... No problem.

0:43:20.941 --> 0:43:22.072
I don't know.

0:43:22.203 --> 0:43:24.553
I'm thinking maybe
blue or black?

0:43:24.684 --> 0:43:25.859
What's the occasion?

0:43:25.989 --> 0:43:26.989
My sister's wedding.

0:43:27.034 --> 0:43:28.601
Oh, very exciting.

0:43:28.731 --> 0:43:30.167
Um, what size are you?

0:43:30.298 --> 0:43:32.082
Usually a 38 or a 40?

0:43:32.213 --> 0:43:33.431
Do you want to try both?

0:43:33.562 --> 0:43:34.781
Yeah.
Let's do it.

0:43:37.174 --> 0:43:39.873
Sir, do you need help?

0:43:40.003 --> 0:43:41.483
I'm good.

0:43:41.614 --> 0:43:43.877
Well, Barbara's right here
if you need anything.

0:43:44.007 --> 0:43:45.226
Mm-hmm.

0:43:45.356 --> 0:43:47.707
Kathy, is this it? Yes.

0:43:47.837 --> 0:43:50.884
Excuse me, ma'am? Truck's here
to pick up that big box.

0:43:51.014 --> 0:43:52.276
Great, thank you.

0:43:52.407 --> 0:43:54.496
Uh...
the guy brought flowers?

0:43:54.627 --> 0:43:56.150
Really?

0:44:25.832 --> 0:44:28.878
Look. Ooh la la! Ooh la la!

0:44:31.228 --> 0:44:32.839
Oh.
Check this out.

0:44:32.882 --> 0:44:34.623
Buongiorno, ladies!

0:44:34.754 --> 0:44:35.905
How much you think
we can get for 'em?

0:44:35.929 --> 0:44:37.529
I don't know.
Maybe... five hundred each?

0:44:37.626 --> 0:44:38.671
But shit, man.

0:44:38.801 --> 0:44:40.368
Maybe I just keep 'em
for myself.

0:44:40.498 --> 0:44:41.891
I've been eyeing these Jordans.

0:44:42.022 --> 0:44:45.547
You guys enjoying yourselves?

0:44:45.678 --> 0:44:46.838
Well, hold onto that feeling.

0:44:46.896 --> 0:44:48.419
'Cause this is it.

0:44:48.550 --> 0:44:49.551
Yeah, we know.

0:44:49.682 --> 0:44:51.292
Well, in case you forget...

0:44:51.422 --> 0:44:52.772
You transported stolen goods

0:44:52.902 --> 0:44:54.817
with a value exceeding
five thousand dollars.

0:44:54.948 --> 0:44:57.559
And the truck you used to do it
was rented in Council Bluffs,

0:44:57.690 --> 0:44:58.952
across state lines.

0:44:59.082 --> 0:45:01.389
You told us to rent
the truck over there...

0:45:01.519 --> 0:45:03.043
Theft from
an Interstate Shipment.

0:45:03.173 --> 0:45:04.740
Up to ten years.

0:45:04.871 --> 0:45:06.831
Transportation of Stolen Goods.
Another ten years.

0:45:06.873 --> 0:45:08.788
Sale of Stolen Goods.
Ten years.

0:45:08.918 --> 0:45:10.659
Conspiracy to commit
a federal crime...

0:45:10.790 --> 0:45:13.793
Whoa, whoa. "Conspiracy"?
It was your idea.

0:45:13.923 --> 0:45:16.709
Yeah. It's called
"mutually assured destruction."

0:45:16.839 --> 0:45:20.974
So, if I go down, you go down.

0:45:21.104 --> 0:45:22.299
Man, you don't
havta threaten us.

0:45:22.323 --> 0:45:23.716
We're all friends here.

0:45:26.631 --> 0:45:29.330
I am not your friend.

0:45:29.460 --> 0:45:30.940
And if you get greedy
and you decide

0:45:31.071 --> 0:45:33.900
to come back for more, don't.

0:45:34.030 --> 0:45:35.771
Gene Takavic...
You never heard of him.

0:45:35.902 --> 0:45:38.339
The Cottonwood Mall?
You don't go there.

0:45:38.469 --> 0:45:42.778
You see me coming, you cross
to the other side of the street.

0:45:42.909 --> 0:45:44.388
Dude...

0:45:44.519 --> 0:45:47.565
Now I need you to say it:
"we're done."

0:45:49.611 --> 0:45:51.526
Come on! Say it.

0:45:51.656 --> 0:45:53.963
"We're. Done."

0:45:54.094 --> 0:45:55.530
Say it.

0:46:05.279 --> 0:46:08.238
We're done.

0:46:08.369 --> 0:46:11.154
We're... We're done.

0:46:11.285 --> 0:46:12.721
Gene?

0:46:16.159 --> 0:46:18.335
Hey, Gene, I see your car!

0:46:22.731 --> 0:46:24.472
Gene?

0:46:35.918 --> 0:46:37.833
Well, that's a start.

0:46:37.964 --> 0:46:40.662
Looks like your problem
is the master cylinder.

0:46:40.793 --> 0:46:44.013
Look at you boys, hard at work.

0:46:44.144 --> 0:46:47.843
Well, Marion, guys,
I got to get going.

0:46:47.974 --> 0:46:50.150
I will take another look
next time.

0:46:50.280 --> 0:46:51.847
Wait a minute.

0:46:51.978 --> 0:46:53.607
No, you can't go anywhere
looking like that.

0:46:53.631 --> 0:46:56.025
Come on inside and wash up.

0:46:56.156 --> 0:46:58.071
Ma...

0:46:58.201 --> 0:47:00.638
Jeffie, don't vex me.
Come on, Gene.

0:47:00.769 --> 0:47:01.877
You can help me
with the groceries.

0:47:01.901 --> 0:47:04.599
Huh, Gene? Sounds like a plan.

0:47:16.219 --> 0:47:18.395
Nice of you to
help Jeffie with his car.

0:47:20.223 --> 0:47:23.748
You might not know it, but
my boy's had some tough times.

0:47:23.879 --> 0:47:28.666
He, uh... He fell in with
a bad crowd back in Albuquerque.

0:47:28.797 --> 0:47:32.105
Albuquerque, huh?
Never been.

0:47:32.235 --> 0:47:34.063
Lucky you.

0:47:34.194 --> 0:47:36.892
But things are so much better
for Jeffie here.

0:47:37.023 --> 0:47:40.156
Even more so
now that he knows you.

0:47:40.287 --> 0:47:43.507
You're a good influence, Gene.

0:47:43.638 --> 0:47:44.726
Oh, where's my brain?

0:47:44.857 --> 0:47:48.121
I keep forgetting to ask you
about Nippy.

0:47:49.600 --> 0:47:50.645
Nippy?

0:47:50.775 --> 0:47:53.648
Oh, oh, right.

0:47:53.778 --> 0:47:54.605
You're not gonna believe this,

0:47:54.736 --> 0:47:56.956
but, uh, he was with a family

0:47:57.086 --> 0:47:59.045
the whole time, just...
Just a few blocks away.

0:47:59.175 --> 0:48:00.481
Oh, well, that's wonderful!

0:48:00.611 --> 0:48:02.265
Yeah.
He's in great shape.

0:48:02.396 --> 0:48:06.095
So, after all that...

0:48:06.226 --> 0:48:08.097
a happy ending.

0:48:08.228 --> 0:48:09.751
Oh, well...

0:48:20.414 --> 0:48:22.503
Here you go, Ma'am.
Thanks.

0:48:22.633 --> 0:48:24.548
And looky here.

0:48:27.900 --> 0:48:30.250
For you, m'lady. Thank you.

0:48:33.514 --> 0:48:36.125
Hey, Gene,
aren't you taking lunch?

0:48:36.256 --> 0:48:37.866
Huh?

0:48:40.477 --> 0:48:42.175
Thanks.

0:50:43.252 --> 0:50:47.430
I get it.
You get over it, okay?

0:50:47.561 --> 0:50:49.258
Please, believe me.

0:50:49.389 --> 0:50:52.740
Before you know it,
you'll forget all about it.

0:50:54.046 --> 0:50:55.438
Go.
