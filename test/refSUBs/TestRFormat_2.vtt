WEBVTT

0:00:25.900 --> 0:00:27.068
That's it.

0:00:28.903 --> 0:00:31.698
Can I just, you know,
look at it for a minute?

0:00:33.158 --> 0:00:34.701
You're an artist, Sid.

0:00:37.120 --> 0:00:39.122
You're telling me
you're just gonna walk out of here

0:00:39.205 --> 0:00:41.166
and I'm never going
to see it again?

0:00:41.249 --> 0:00:42.792
There's a good chance
of that, yes.

0:00:44.210 --> 0:00:45.879
Most guys, you know,
for the first one,

0:00:45.962 --> 0:00:47.589
they start
with something small.

0:00:47.672 --> 0:00:50.258
"Mom," girlfriend's initials,
something like that.

0:00:50.925 --> 0:00:53.219
Not you.

0:00:53.303 --> 0:00:56.514
You get a full set of sleeves,
all in a couple of months.

0:00:56.598 --> 0:00:58.933
Takes guys a few years
to get the ink you got.

0:01:00.310 --> 0:01:02.062
I don't have
a few years.

0:01:03.646 --> 0:01:05.398
Wish to hell I did.

0:01:59.536 --> 0:02:00.829
The vault. Open it.

0:02:00.912 --> 0:02:02.997
We can't. The branch
manager's not here.

0:02:05.208 --> 0:02:06.876
-Where is he?
-It's lunchtime.

0:02:06.960 --> 0:02:08.044
He's at White Castle.

0:02:08.461 --> 0:02:09.337
White Castle?

0:02:09.420 --> 0:02:10.463
It's a fast food restaurant.

0:02:10.547 --> 0:02:13.508
They serve
those little square burgers.

0:02:14.050 --> 0:02:15.301
I know what it is.

0:02:17.762 --> 0:02:19.055
I'm not playing games.

0:02:19.430 --> 0:02:20.557
Open it.

0:02:20.640 --> 0:02:22.809
Sir, you have a half
a million dollars cash in your bag.

0:02:22.892 --> 0:02:24.727
Don't you think
it would be better...

0:02:35.572 --> 0:02:37.240
This is the police.

0:02:37.323 --> 0:02:39.659
You are completely surrounded.

0:02:41.911 --> 0:02:43.246
Put down your weapon.

0:02:45.665 --> 0:02:47.667
Put down your weapons now.

0:02:52.046 --> 0:02:53.840
Rarely in the case
of armed robbery

0:02:53.923 --> 0:02:55.925
do we hear a plea
of no contest.

0:02:56.009 --> 0:02:58.052
Are you sure about this,
Mr. Scofield?

0:02:58.136 --> 0:02:59.637
I'm sure, Your Honor.

0:02:59.721 --> 0:03:01.848
Your Honor, we'd like
to recess if we could.

0:03:01.931 --> 0:03:03.766
My client's a bit confused
at the moment.

0:03:03.850 --> 0:03:04.684
I'm not, Your Honor.

0:03:04.767 --> 0:03:06.060
He is, Your Honor.

0:03:06.144 --> 0:03:08.563
Perhaps you should heed
your representation's advice,

0:03:08.646 --> 0:03:11.274
take some additional time
to consider your response.

0:03:11.357 --> 0:03:12.650
I've already done that,
Your Honor.

0:03:19.199 --> 0:03:21.868
I'll retire to my chambers
to determine sentencing.

0:03:21.951 --> 0:03:23.786
Court's recessed until 1:30.

0:03:26.122 --> 0:03:27.040
Come on, let's go.

0:03:27.123 --> 0:03:28.166
Uncle Mike?

0:03:30.627 --> 0:03:32.003
I didn't want you to come.

0:03:32.629 --> 0:03:34.297
Go home, LJ.

0:03:34.589 --> 0:03:36.299
I didn't want you
to see this.

0:03:43.890 --> 0:03:45.058
He's not gonna
take this well.

0:03:45.141 --> 0:03:47.018
Can you blame him?
He's your nephew.

0:03:47.101 --> 0:03:48.102
He's beginning
to get the idea

0:03:48.186 --> 0:03:49.729
that anybody
he attaches himself to

0:03:49.812 --> 0:03:51.648
is gonna
end up in prison...

0:03:51.731 --> 0:03:52.649
And he's not the only one

0:03:52.732 --> 0:03:54.108
who's starting to feel
that way, Michael.

0:03:55.985 --> 0:03:57.403
Will you give us a minute?

0:03:57.487 --> 0:03:58.446
One minute.

0:03:59.155 --> 0:04:00.782
Don't you understand?

0:04:00.865 --> 0:04:02.367
You just put the book
in that woman's hand

0:04:02.450 --> 0:04:04.577
and she's gonna lob it
at you like a grenade.

0:04:04.661 --> 0:04:07.121
Justice and punishment
are the same thing to her.

0:04:07.413 --> 0:04:08.539
I know.

0:04:08.623 --> 0:04:10.917
Then will you please tell me
what's going through your head?

0:04:11.000 --> 0:04:12.043
We've been over this.

0:04:12.126 --> 0:04:13.419
I've known you
my entire life.

0:04:13.503 --> 0:04:15.838
You don't have
a violent bone in your body,

0:04:15.922 --> 0:04:17.799
and I know you didn't
need the money.

0:04:17.882 --> 0:04:18.758
Veronica.

0:04:18.841 --> 0:04:20.760
Why won't you
let me help you?

0:04:20.843 --> 0:04:22.053
You've been good to me.

0:04:22.136 --> 0:04:23.763
My whole life, you have.

0:04:24.931 --> 0:04:26.349
But you've gotta let me
deal with this.

0:04:26.683 --> 0:04:28.434
Okay?

0:04:28.977 --> 0:04:30.770
Given your lack
of prior criminal conduct,

0:04:31.396 --> 0:04:33.940
I am inclined
toward probation.

0:04:34.023 --> 0:04:36.150
However, the fact that
you discharged a deadly weapon

0:04:36.234 --> 0:04:39.112
during the commission
of the crime suggests malice to me.

0:04:39.195 --> 0:04:41.364
For that reason,
I find it incumbent

0:04:41.447 --> 0:04:44.242
that you see the inside
of a prison cell, Mr. Scofield.

0:04:45.368 --> 0:04:47.954
It says here
that you've requested to be incarcerated

0:04:48.037 --> 0:04:50.123
somewhere near your home
here in Chicago.

0:04:50.206 --> 0:04:51.791
I'm willing to honor that.

0:04:51.874 --> 0:04:53.376
The closest
level one facility to--

0:04:53.459 --> 0:04:54.294
Level one?

0:04:54.377 --> 0:04:56.254
That's maximum security,
Your Honor.

0:04:56.337 --> 0:04:59.590
I would ask counsel to refrain
from interrupting me.

0:04:59.674 --> 0:05:00.633
As I was saying,

0:05:00.717 --> 0:05:02.135
the closest
level one facility

0:05:02.218 --> 0:05:04.220
would be Fox River
State Penitentiary.

0:05:04.304 --> 0:05:05.888
As for the term
of your sentence,

0:05:05.972 --> 0:05:07.473
I'm setting it
at five years.

0:05:07.557 --> 0:05:09.976
You'll be eligible for parole
in half that time.

0:05:10.059 --> 0:05:12.437
Sentence to be carried out immediately.

0:05:25.575 --> 0:05:28.119
Okay, step inside the door
and check yourself for bugs.

0:05:28.202 --> 0:05:29.662
When you hear
the knock, step out.

0:05:29.746 --> 0:05:31.039
Keep the line moving.

0:05:31.122 --> 0:05:33.166
We ain't got all day
to get this done.

0:05:33.249 --> 0:05:34.667
- Let's go. Move it.
- No more talking in line.

0:05:34.751 --> 0:05:36.794
Move it. You got less
than five minutes to take a shower.

0:05:36.878 --> 0:05:38.421
Keep the line moving.
Keep it moving.

0:05:38.504 --> 0:05:41.049
- Move it. Right now. Let's go. Move, move.
- Next!

0:05:44.218 --> 0:05:45.553
Name and back number.

0:05:45.636 --> 0:05:46.888
Scofield, Michael.

0:05:46.971 --> 0:05:47.930
94941.

0:05:48.014 --> 0:05:49.557
Are you
a religious man, Scofield?

0:05:49.640 --> 0:05:50.641
Never really
thought about it.

0:05:50.725 --> 0:05:51.726
Good, 'cause
the Ten Commandments

0:05:51.809 --> 0:05:52.935
don't mean
a box of piss in here.

0:05:53.019 --> 0:05:54.145
We got two commandments
and two only.

0:05:54.228 --> 0:05:56.898
The first commandment
is you got nothing coming.

0:05:56.981 --> 0:05:58.358
What's the second commandment?

0:05:58.441 --> 0:05:59.525
See commandment number one.

0:05:59.609 --> 0:06:01.152
Gotcha.

0:06:02.445 --> 0:06:03.988
You talking out the side
of your neck?

0:06:04.530 --> 0:06:05.573
Come again?

0:06:05.656 --> 0:06:08.576
I said, are you
being a smartass?

0:06:08.659 --> 0:06:11.079
Just trying to fly low,
avoid the radar, boss.

0:06:11.162 --> 0:06:12.955
Do my time... and get out.

0:06:14.332 --> 0:06:16.125
There isn't any flying
under my radar.

0:06:17.126 --> 0:06:18.127
Good to know.

0:06:39.315 --> 0:06:41.609
Hey, can a brother
get some air conditioning up here, cuz?

0:06:41.692 --> 0:06:43.778
It's hotter than
a crack ho's mouth, man.

0:06:43.861 --> 0:06:46.197
To hell with the AC, man.
Give me the crack ho.

0:06:49.659 --> 0:06:50.910
Come on!

0:06:54.205 --> 0:06:55.248
Yo, Fish!

0:06:55.331 --> 0:06:56.707
What you looking at?

0:06:56.791 --> 0:06:58.835
You look kind of pretty
to be up in here, man.

0:06:59.836 --> 0:07:00.711
Fish!

0:07:02.463 --> 0:07:03.965
I suggest you
take a seat, Fish.

0:07:05.508 --> 0:07:07.885
Ain't nothing to do up in here
but serve time.

0:07:07.969 --> 0:07:09.929
Ain't nobody
gonna serve it for you.

0:07:25.695 --> 0:07:27.238
Welcome to
Prisneyland, Fish.

0:07:34.912 --> 0:07:36.747
...is now
on mandatory lockdown...

0:07:54.182 --> 0:07:55.975
You wanna talk
about it?

0:07:56.058 --> 0:07:57.685
No, it's not
worth talking about.

0:07:57.768 --> 0:08:00.021
If it's keeping you up,
it is.

0:08:00.104 --> 0:08:01.689
Oh, it's just...

0:08:01.772 --> 0:08:03.733
It's nothing, you know.

0:08:04.942 --> 0:08:05.943
Michael's case.

0:08:07.111 --> 0:08:08.529
You did the best you could.

0:08:08.613 --> 0:08:10.114
Yeah, but he didn't.

0:08:11.491 --> 0:08:12.408
He just sort of rolled over.

0:08:12.492 --> 0:08:14.118
He didn't put up a fight.

0:08:14.202 --> 0:08:15.077
It's not like him.

0:08:17.205 --> 0:08:19.290
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
be talking about him.

0:08:19.373 --> 0:08:22.293
Hey, if it's on your mind,
it's on your mind, right?

0:08:24.378 --> 0:08:25.671
Good night.

0:08:34.972 --> 0:08:37.266
All wings, guard coming out.

0:08:37.350 --> 0:08:39.310
All wings,
guard coming out.

0:08:43.814 --> 0:08:45.149
Trey Street Deuces
got the hoops.

0:08:45.858 --> 0:08:47.652
Nortenos got the bleachers.

0:08:48.319 --> 0:08:49.779
Woods got the weight pile.

0:08:51.072 --> 0:08:52.657
The C.O.s got the rest.

0:08:52.740 --> 0:08:56.452
I'm telling you, the guards
are the dirtiest gang in this whole place.

0:08:56.536 --> 0:08:58.329
The only difference
between us and them...

0:08:58.412 --> 0:08:59.997
is the badge.

0:09:00.081 --> 0:09:01.040
Who's the pet lover?

0:09:01.123 --> 0:09:02.917
He'll deny it,
but he's D.B. Cooper.

0:09:03.000 --> 0:09:07.088
Parachuted out of a plane
30 years ago with a million and a half in cash.

0:09:07.171 --> 0:09:08.839
Doesn't look
like the type.

0:09:08.923 --> 0:09:09.924
Who does?

0:09:10.007 --> 0:09:12.176
Hey! What up, Wholesale?

0:09:12.260 --> 0:09:13.928
-You okay?
-Gonna be greater later.

0:09:14.011 --> 0:09:14.845
Yeah.

0:09:14.929 --> 0:09:16.472
What you doing
with this fish, man?

0:09:16.556 --> 0:09:17.974
-He's my new cellie.
-Huh.

0:09:18.057 --> 0:09:20.935
Wholesale's got it wired up
at the commissary.

0:09:21.018 --> 0:09:22.812
Anything you want,
he can get it for you.

0:09:22.895 --> 0:09:24.272
You keep
handing out my jacket,

0:09:24.355 --> 0:09:25.731
I swear I'm gonna
bust your grape.

0:09:25.815 --> 0:09:27.775
Man, you couldn't bust a grape in Napa
with a set of cleats on.

0:09:27.858 --> 0:09:29.694
-What are you talking about?
-Man, you want to bump your gums.

0:09:29.777 --> 0:09:31.904
Oh, no, no. Now you're
talking, talking, talking...

0:09:59.765 --> 0:10:01.350
I'm looking for someone.

0:10:03.019 --> 0:10:04.687
Guy named Lincoln Burrows.

0:10:04.770 --> 0:10:06.105
Linc the Sink?

0:10:06.188 --> 0:10:07.607
That what
they're calling him now?

0:10:08.024 --> 0:10:09.275
Yeah.

0:10:09.358 --> 0:10:11.277
As in, he'll come at you
with everything but the kitchen...

0:10:11.360 --> 0:10:12.486
Snowflake.

0:10:12.570 --> 0:10:13.988
Where can I find him?

0:10:15.448 --> 0:10:17.533
Man killed
the Vice President's brother.

0:10:17.617 --> 0:10:19.035
In a month,
he's getting the chair,

0:10:19.118 --> 0:10:21.787
which means no one up this river
is more dangerous than him,

0:10:21.871 --> 0:10:23.205
'cause he's got
nothing to lose now.

0:10:23.289 --> 0:10:25.458
What are they gonna do?
Kill him twice?

0:10:25.541 --> 0:10:26.417
There a way
I can get to him?

0:10:26.500 --> 0:10:28.336
Oh, no. The only time
those boys get out

0:10:28.419 --> 0:10:29.879
is for chapel and P.I.

0:10:30.546 --> 0:10:32.173
P.I.? What's that?

0:10:32.256 --> 0:10:33.174
Prison Industry.

0:10:33.257 --> 0:10:34.967
The guys that get along
get to work.

0:10:35.051 --> 0:10:39.513
You know, painting, scrapping,
making mattresses, you name it.

0:10:39.597 --> 0:10:41.682
I wouldn't get excited, though,
if I were you, Fish.

0:10:41.766 --> 0:10:43.225
You ain't sniffin'
none of P.I.

0:10:43.559 --> 0:10:44.685
Why's that?

0:10:44.769 --> 0:10:46.354
'Cause John Abruzzi runs it.

0:10:47.188 --> 0:10:48.814
"John Abruzzi" John Abruzzi?

0:10:48.898 --> 0:10:51.108
"John Abruzzi" John Abruzzi.

0:10:51.192 --> 0:10:53.277
Why you wanna see Burrows
so bad anyhow?

0:10:57.114 --> 0:10:58.574
Because he's my brother.

0:11:21.806 --> 0:11:22.807
They denied the motion.

0:11:22.890 --> 0:11:23.808
Then do it again.

0:11:23.891 --> 0:11:24.850
I can't. That's it.

0:11:24.934 --> 0:11:27.019
May 11th.
That's the date, man.

0:11:27.103 --> 0:11:28.604
That's the date they,
uh, you know...

0:11:29.271 --> 0:11:30.356
execute me.

0:11:30.856 --> 0:11:32.108
I know.

0:11:37.780 --> 0:11:39.657
I didn't
kill that man, Michael.

0:11:39.740 --> 0:11:41.117
The evidence says you did.

0:11:41.200 --> 0:11:42.660
I don't care
what the evidence says.

0:11:42.743 --> 0:11:43.619
I didn't kill him.

0:11:44.787 --> 0:11:46.080
Swear to me.

0:11:48.124 --> 0:11:49.542
I swear to you, Michael.

0:11:55.297 --> 0:11:57.925
But how did they get it wrong then?

0:11:58.008 --> 0:11:59.468
The courts,
the appeals.

0:11:59.552 --> 0:12:01.929
Don't know. Don't know.

0:12:02.012 --> 0:12:03.889
All I keep thinking,
looking back on it is, uh...

0:12:03.973 --> 0:12:05.015
I was set up.

0:12:06.308 --> 0:12:07.393
And whoever it was
that set me up

0:12:07.476 --> 0:12:09.562
wants me in the ground
as quickly as possible.

0:12:15.151 --> 0:12:16.861
What's another word
for "love"?

0:12:16.944 --> 0:12:18.237
What's the context?

0:12:18.320 --> 0:12:19.572
Oh, you know.

0:12:19.655 --> 0:12:20.990
The "I love you so much

0:12:21.073 --> 0:12:23.826
I ain't never knocking over
a liquor store again" context.

0:12:23.909 --> 0:12:25.327
Except, you know, classy.

0:12:25.619 --> 0:12:27.246
Mmm.

0:12:27.329 --> 0:12:29.206
I'm proposing to my girl,
if you gotta know.

0:12:29.665 --> 0:12:30.583
In a letter?

0:12:30.666 --> 0:12:31.500
You got a better way?

0:12:31.584 --> 0:12:33.294
Face-to-face
works pretty good.

0:12:33.377 --> 0:12:36.505
This place ain't exactly
the romantic spot.

0:12:36.589 --> 0:12:38.924
I'm gonna have her get
on the Staten Island Ferry.

0:12:39.008 --> 0:12:41.552
Then, once she can see
the Empire State Building,

0:12:41.635 --> 0:12:42.928
she opens the letter...

0:12:43.012 --> 0:12:45.097
It's like almost being there.

0:12:45.181 --> 0:12:46.891
Except for the fact
that I won't be there.

0:12:48.225 --> 0:12:49.143
Try "passion."

0:12:49.226 --> 0:12:51.103
Ooh! Ooh! "Passion."
"Passion." That's dope.

0:12:51.854 --> 0:12:53.022
Passion.

0:12:54.690 --> 0:12:55.775
How do you spell that?

0:12:55.858 --> 0:12:57.610
-Is it P-A-S-H?
-Uh-uh.

0:12:59.403 --> 0:13:00.404
No "H"?

0:13:06.827 --> 0:13:08.287
LJ, hold up.

0:13:08.370 --> 0:13:09.955
Hold up.

0:13:10.039 --> 0:13:12.041
I don't think I can
go through with this.

0:13:12.124 --> 0:13:13.542
Everything's going
to be fine.

0:13:14.543 --> 0:13:15.753
Trust me.

0:13:25.930 --> 0:13:27.139
We understand
each other, then?

0:13:27.223 --> 0:13:28.224
-Yeah.
-Friday.

0:13:28.307 --> 0:13:30.559
Not Saturday.
Not Sunday. Friday.

0:13:30.643 --> 0:13:32.144
It's totally understood.

0:13:32.228 --> 0:13:33.896
I don't want hundreds,
I don't want fives, I don't want ones.

0:13:33.979 --> 0:13:34.897
I know, I know.

0:13:34.980 --> 0:13:36.148
Tens and 20s only.

0:13:45.783 --> 0:13:47.535
It's on.

0:14:00.381 --> 0:14:01.674
Police!

0:14:24.822 --> 0:14:27.283
Abruzzi, I need you
to hire me a P.I.

0:14:29.326 --> 0:14:31.078
Beat it.

0:14:31.161 --> 0:14:32.997
Maybe you ought to hear
what I got to say.

0:14:33.080 --> 0:14:34.540
You got nothing I need.

0:14:37.167 --> 0:14:38.544
Wouldn't be
too sure of that.

0:14:39.837 --> 0:14:41.171
My mistake.

0:14:42.131 --> 0:14:45.092
Just what I need... a duck.

0:14:46.051 --> 0:14:47.428
P.I., Abruzzi.

0:14:47.511 --> 0:14:50.139
You might find I can be
of more assistance than you think.

0:14:53.100 --> 0:14:54.310
Mull it over.

0:14:55.561 --> 0:14:57.271
Come find me
when you're ready to talk.

0:15:04.778 --> 0:15:06.780
All right, guys,
pick it up!

0:15:06.864 --> 0:15:08.324
I want to get home tonight!

0:15:08.616 --> 0:15:09.700
Maggio.

0:15:16.874 --> 0:15:18.042
Yeah? So?

0:15:18.125 --> 0:15:19.752
That's the son of a bitch
that fingered Abruzzi.

0:15:21.003 --> 0:15:22.171
That's Fibonacci?

0:15:23.505 --> 0:15:25.716
I thought the punk
was gone forever.

0:15:25.799 --> 0:15:27.718
Evidently,
somebody found him.

0:15:27.801 --> 0:15:29.803
Somebody messing with us?

0:15:29.887 --> 0:15:31.430
This you're not
going to believe.

0:15:35.392 --> 0:15:36.477
What is it?

0:15:41.482 --> 0:15:43.817
Tattoo looks fresh.
Hold that.

0:15:45.235 --> 0:15:47.571
I guess, being a diabetic,
you don't mind needles.

0:15:48.280 --> 0:15:49.990
I'm Michael, by the way.

0:15:50.074 --> 0:15:51.784
Scofield.
I read your report.

0:15:52.576 --> 0:15:53.994
And you are?

0:15:54.078 --> 0:15:55.871
Dr. Tancredi will do.

0:15:55.955 --> 0:15:57.331
"Tancredi" like the governor?

0:15:59.416 --> 0:16:00.793
You're not related,
are you?

0:16:02.378 --> 0:16:04.838
Hmm. Wouldn't think
you'd find the daughter

0:16:04.922 --> 0:16:07.424
of Frontier Justice Frank
working in a prison.

0:16:08.175 --> 0:16:10.177
As a doctor, no less.

0:16:10.260 --> 0:16:13.305
I believe in being part
of the solution, not the problem.

0:16:13.389 --> 0:16:17.601
Hmm. "Be the change you want
to see in the world."

0:16:21.563 --> 0:16:22.439
What?

0:16:24.191 --> 0:16:26.110
Nothing. That was just
my senior quote.

0:16:26.652 --> 0:16:27.653
That was you?

0:16:27.736 --> 0:16:29.697
This whole time,
I was thinking it was Gandhi.

0:16:29.780 --> 0:16:32.366
You're very funny.

0:16:32.449 --> 0:16:34.493
Sit tight.
Put direct pressure on that.

0:16:34.576 --> 0:16:35.619
I'll be back
in a sec.

0:16:50.801 --> 0:16:51.885
So, how do we play this?

0:16:51.969 --> 0:16:54.096
You hook me up
with a few weeks' supply?

0:16:54.179 --> 0:16:56.724
Nice try.
No hypos on the floor.

0:16:56.807 --> 0:16:59.852
I'm the farthest thing
from a junkie. Trust me.

0:16:59.935 --> 0:17:01.228
I got news
for you, Michael.

0:17:01.311 --> 0:17:03.564
"Trust me" means absolutely zero
inside these walls.

0:17:03.647 --> 0:17:05.149
The only way
you're getting that insulin

0:17:05.232 --> 0:17:07.276
is if I'm administering it.

0:17:07.359 --> 0:17:09.570
Guess we'll be seeing
a lot of each other, then, huh?

0:17:10.446 --> 0:17:11.447
I guess so.

0:17:24.460 --> 0:17:26.628
We're all clear
on the Burrows execution.

0:17:26.712 --> 0:17:28.338
-Good.
-Except for one thing.

0:17:28.422 --> 0:17:30.632
Bishop McMorrow
is not in the fold.

0:17:33.343 --> 0:17:35.888
He's got a lot of influence
with the governor.

0:17:35.971 --> 0:17:37.806
They went to prep school
together, apparently.

0:17:39.141 --> 0:17:42.102
Look, the closer it gets,
the more I'm worried

0:17:42.186 --> 0:17:44.396
that the bottom is going
to fall out of this whole thing.

0:17:48.859 --> 0:17:51.528
Well, maybe it's time you arranged a visit
with the good bishop, then.

0:17:53.572 --> 0:17:57.743
Look, in one month,
it'll all be over.

0:17:57.826 --> 0:18:02.206
"The Son of Man must be delivered
into the hands of sinful men

0:18:02.289 --> 0:18:06.168
and be crucified
and the third day, rise again."

0:18:06.251 --> 0:18:10.047
And they remembered His words,
and so should you.

0:18:10.130 --> 0:18:12.299
Good day, gentlemen.
May God be with you.

0:18:17.554 --> 0:18:19.389
Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

0:18:24.812 --> 0:18:26.063
Michael.

0:18:28.690 --> 0:18:30.818
Let's go. Come on, man.
Keep moving.

0:18:30.901 --> 0:18:32.236
Keep moving.
Move. Come on.

0:18:32.319 --> 0:18:34.154
- Why?
- Let's go, man. Come on.

0:18:34.238 --> 0:18:36.156
I'm getting you
out of here.

0:18:36.240 --> 0:18:38.408
Burrows, roll it up.
Happy hour's over.

0:18:39.743 --> 0:18:40.994
It's impossible.

0:18:41.078 --> 0:18:42.663
Not if you designed
the place, it isn't.

0:18:51.588 --> 0:18:52.589
Too formal.

0:18:55.592 --> 0:18:57.177
Too "greeting card."

0:18:57.261 --> 0:18:58.679
Well, we got
to make a decision

0:18:58.762 --> 0:19:00.347
sooner or later,
you know.

0:19:00.430 --> 0:19:01.306
We have time.

0:19:01.390 --> 0:19:04.268
We don't, actually.

0:19:04.351 --> 0:19:07.771
I mean, at some point,
we got to pull the trigger on this thing.

0:19:07.855 --> 0:19:09.356
I don't want
to rush this.

0:19:09.439 --> 0:19:10.649
We're only going
to do it once.

0:19:10.732 --> 0:19:11.733
We have to
get it right.

0:19:17.406 --> 0:19:20.284
Honey, can I
ask you something?

0:19:20.367 --> 0:19:21.285
Of course.

0:19:22.286 --> 0:19:23.704
Are you putting this off?

0:19:23.787 --> 0:19:25.038
What do you mean?

0:19:25.122 --> 0:19:27.040
I mean, are you
having second thoughts?

0:19:27.666 --> 0:19:30.085
No. Honey, no.

0:19:30.711 --> 0:19:31.670
I'm not.

0:19:32.504 --> 0:19:33.714
I don't know.

0:19:33.797 --> 0:19:36.133
-I just can't help thinking this is about--
-It's not.

0:19:37.968 --> 0:19:39.136
I love you.

0:19:40.137 --> 0:19:41.722
And I want
to be your wife.

0:19:45.976 --> 0:19:47.144
Passion?

0:19:47.227 --> 0:19:48.228
What were you thinking?

0:19:48.312 --> 0:19:49.396
Hey, you went for it.

0:19:49.479 --> 0:19:51.565
She probably thinks
I went sissy up in here.

0:19:51.648 --> 0:19:56.111
"Passion." You know,
got more than one syllable, too much talkin'.

0:19:56.195 --> 0:19:58.322
That's me from now on.
One-syllable Sucre.

0:19:58.405 --> 0:20:00.574
Yes. No. Love.

0:20:00.657 --> 0:20:02.075
Hate. Love.

0:20:02.159 --> 0:20:03.410
Give it time.

0:20:03.493 --> 0:20:04.745
Are you kidding?

0:20:04.828 --> 0:20:06.121
I proposed to her.

0:20:06.205 --> 0:20:07.581
That doesn't take time.

0:20:07.664 --> 0:20:08.916
Si or no.

0:20:08.999 --> 0:20:10.083
One syllable, man.

0:20:13.503 --> 0:20:14.504
She's supposed
to come around

0:20:14.588 --> 0:20:16.173
for a conjugal on Tuesday.

0:20:16.256 --> 0:20:17.633
She's always
calling me beforehand,

0:20:17.716 --> 0:20:19.718
letting me know
she's coming.

0:20:19.801 --> 0:20:22.346
This time, man,
I ain't heard a peep.

0:20:23.639 --> 0:20:24.848
You spooked her.

0:20:25.849 --> 0:20:26.934
Scofield.

0:20:27.017 --> 0:20:29.228
Get it together.
Pope wants to see you.

0:20:33.523 --> 0:20:35.025
No good, Fish.

0:20:35.108 --> 0:20:37.152
No one gets an audience
with the Pope.

0:20:37.236 --> 0:20:39.988
Not unless he's real interested
in what you got going on.

0:20:41.198 --> 0:20:43.408
Top of your class at Loyola.

0:20:43.492 --> 0:20:46.453
Magna cum laude, in fact.

0:20:46.536 --> 0:20:49.373
I can't help wondering
what someone with your credentials

0:20:49.456 --> 0:20:51.041
is doing in a place like this.

0:20:52.376 --> 0:20:55.128
Took a wrong turn
a few months back, I guess.

0:20:55.212 --> 0:20:57.256
You make it sound
like a traffic infraction.

0:20:57.339 --> 0:21:00.509
Like all you did was turn the wrong way
up a one-way street.

0:21:00.592 --> 0:21:02.719
Everyone turns up one
sooner or later.

0:21:05.931 --> 0:21:08.642
The reason
I called you here...

0:21:08.725 --> 0:21:11.645
I noticed in your I-file,
under occupation,

0:21:11.728 --> 0:21:13.772
you put down "unemployed."

0:21:14.523 --> 0:21:15.983
That's not true, now, is it?

0:21:19.111 --> 0:21:22.322
I know you're
a structural engineer, Scofield.

0:21:25.534 --> 0:21:28.078
Shah Jahan
built the Taj Majal

0:21:28.161 --> 0:21:31.832
as a monument
to his undying love for his wife.

0:21:31.915 --> 0:21:34.668
My wife is quite fond
of the story.

0:21:34.751 --> 0:21:36.753
It appeals
to the romantic in her.

0:21:38.964 --> 0:21:42.676
Being married to someone
in Corrections, terrible job.

0:21:42.759 --> 0:21:44.219
Wouldn't wish it on anyone.

0:21:44.761 --> 0:21:47.097
And yet, in 39 years,

0:21:47.180 --> 0:21:49.808
my wife
has never complained.

0:21:49.891 --> 0:21:52.227
And the worst part of it is,
I've never thanked her.

0:21:54.730 --> 0:21:57.149
So, because
I couldn't say it,

0:21:57.232 --> 0:21:59.318
I thought, you know,
I could build it.

0:22:00.819 --> 0:22:03.405
Come June,
it's our 40th anniversary.

0:22:05.741 --> 0:22:07.534
But here, look.

0:22:07.617 --> 0:22:08.994
You see,
the problem is,

0:22:09.536 --> 0:22:11.079
I build anymore,

0:22:11.163 --> 0:22:14.207
it's all gonna come down
like a house of cards.

0:22:14.291 --> 0:22:17.377
That's where I was hoping
you could be of assistance.

0:22:17.461 --> 0:22:18.837
For the favor,
I can offer you

0:22:18.920 --> 0:22:21.631
three days of work
a week in here.

0:22:21.715 --> 0:22:23.675
And it'll keep you
off the yard.

0:22:26.595 --> 0:22:27.846
Mmm.

0:22:30.766 --> 0:22:31.975
I can't do it.

0:22:33.977 --> 0:22:37.397
Son, it's better for me
to owe you one in here

0:22:37.481 --> 0:22:38.774
than it is for you
to owe me one,

0:22:38.857 --> 0:22:40.317
I can promise you that.

0:22:40.984 --> 0:22:42.319
I'll take my chances.

0:22:45.447 --> 0:22:46.782
Then we're through here.

0:22:47.991 --> 0:22:49.117
Guard!

0:22:51.953 --> 0:22:54.247
Two pounds of pot?

0:22:54.331 --> 0:22:55.957
What were you trying to do,
set a record?

0:22:56.625 --> 0:22:58.043
It's not funny, LJ.

0:22:58.126 --> 0:22:59.669
You could be going
to jail.

0:23:01.129 --> 0:23:03.673
It's pretty obvious to me
you need some guidance.

0:23:05.884 --> 0:23:06.802
Hey.

0:23:07.677 --> 0:23:08.678
Thanks.

0:23:11.181 --> 0:23:12.349
From who,
old Daddy Warbucks?

0:23:12.432 --> 0:23:14.309
Give him a chance.
He's a good man.

0:23:14.393 --> 0:23:16.311
We got nothing in common.

0:23:16.395 --> 0:23:18.688
Come on. Where is this
coming from, LJ?

0:23:18.772 --> 0:23:21.650
Last semester you were getting
almost all A's and now...

0:23:25.320 --> 0:23:26.905
It's your father, isn't it?

0:23:26.988 --> 0:23:28.198
I don't have a father.

0:23:28.281 --> 0:23:30.200
It wasn't an immaculate
conception, honey.

0:23:30.283 --> 0:23:31.493
Trust me.

0:23:34.579 --> 0:23:36.373
Maybe it's time
we went and saw him.

0:23:37.707 --> 0:23:38.667
Mom...

0:23:39.084 --> 0:23:39.960
Mom.

0:23:40.836 --> 0:23:41.795
Don't.

0:23:41.878 --> 0:23:43.255
I'm about as excited
by the prospect as you are,

0:23:43.338 --> 0:23:45.006
but something's gotta give.

0:23:45.090 --> 0:23:46.425
You have got
too much potential

0:23:46.508 --> 0:23:48.385
to be screwing up
your life like this.

0:23:52.389 --> 0:23:56.435
What if they'd sent you
to Taylorville or Marion and not here?

0:23:56.518 --> 0:23:59.020
I think I'd be doing
the same thing I'm doing in here.

0:23:59.104 --> 0:24:01.273
Eating Jell-O,
drinking Kool-Aid...

0:24:01.356 --> 0:24:03.024
I know what you're doing.

0:24:03.108 --> 0:24:05.652
It's not the luck of the draw
that you're in here with Lincoln.

0:24:06.903 --> 0:24:08.029
You forget I know you.

0:24:08.113 --> 0:24:09.531
Both of you.

0:24:09.614 --> 0:24:12.826
You two have the most
dysfunctional idea of love I've ever seen.

0:24:12.909 --> 0:24:15.454
What, he beats you up
to keep you off the streets,

0:24:15.537 --> 0:24:17.831
so you get yourself tossed
into Fox River with him?

0:24:18.540 --> 0:24:19.666
To what?

0:24:19.749 --> 0:24:20.834
Save him?

0:24:23.170 --> 0:24:24.171
I deserve to know.

0:24:24.254 --> 0:24:26.131
I loved him
as much as you did.

0:24:26.214 --> 0:24:29.468
Past tense for you, maybe.
Not me.

0:24:29.551 --> 0:24:32.596
I gave him a shot
when I got back from college. I did.

0:24:32.679 --> 0:24:34.347
Even with all the stuff
that was going on with him,

0:24:34.431 --> 0:24:36.141
I did everything I could
to make it work.

0:24:36.224 --> 0:24:37.434
And he threw it away.

0:24:37.517 --> 0:24:39.144
You ever think maybe he was hurt
that you left

0:24:39.227 --> 0:24:40.353
in the first place?

0:24:41.396 --> 0:24:42.939
Don't do this.

0:24:43.023 --> 0:24:44.816
Whatever it is you're doing,
don't do it.

0:24:44.900 --> 0:24:45.859
There's a better way.

0:24:45.942 --> 0:24:47.110
I'm already appealing
your case.

0:24:47.194 --> 0:24:48.945
I told you
to leave that alone.

0:24:49.029 --> 0:24:50.780
I've gotten in touch with the diocese about Lincoln.
The bishop may be able to help.

0:24:50.864 --> 0:24:53.074
That won't stop it.
It'll only delay it.

0:24:57.245 --> 0:24:59.498
You want
to do something?

0:24:59.581 --> 0:25:01.333
You find out
who's trying to bury him.

0:25:04.294 --> 0:25:06.338
Nobody's trying to bury him.

0:25:06.421 --> 0:25:08.048
The evidence was there.

0:25:08.131 --> 0:25:09.591
The evidence was cooked.

0:25:12.385 --> 0:25:14.930
Visiting hours
are now over.

0:25:19.768 --> 0:25:21.353
Take care of yourself.

0:25:23.271 --> 0:25:25.482
Someone wants him
dead, Veronica.

0:25:25.565 --> 0:25:27.567
Something more
is going on here.

0:25:28.401 --> 0:25:29.611
This is desperation, Michael.

0:25:29.694 --> 0:25:31.738
You're grabbing at straws.
You're in denial.

0:25:31.821 --> 0:25:32.656
Maybe.

0:25:32.739 --> 0:25:33.990
But I can't watch him die.

0:25:34.783 --> 0:25:35.742
I won't do that.

0:26:05.981 --> 0:26:07.232
Gentlemen...

0:26:07.315 --> 0:26:10.151
What is it about the Burrows situation
that I can help you with?

0:26:10.235 --> 0:26:13.154
It's our understanding
that you have great influence with the governor.

0:26:13.238 --> 0:26:17.742
I wouldn't say it's "great" or "influence."

0:26:17.826 --> 0:26:19.077
We're friends.

0:26:19.160 --> 0:26:22.038
It's also our understanding
that you oppose the death penalty.

0:26:22.122 --> 0:26:23.873
I'm a man of God.
How could I not?

0:26:23.957 --> 0:26:27.168
In this case, we're hoping
you'll suspend that position.

0:26:27.252 --> 0:26:28.878
At least temporarily.

0:26:28.962 --> 0:26:32.966
If the inmate appeals
to me for intervention,

0:26:33.049 --> 0:26:34.509
how can I
turn my back on him?

0:26:34.593 --> 0:26:37.554
You have a habit of answering
a question with a question.

0:26:37.637 --> 0:26:40.932
And you have a way of asking questions
that beg more questions.

0:26:45.645 --> 0:26:47.147
Are you saying
you won't do it?

0:26:47.230 --> 0:26:48.898
I'm not a man to equivocate.

0:26:52.736 --> 0:26:55.822
You're, what, 62 years old now,
Your Excellency.

0:26:55.905 --> 0:26:56.823
That's right.

0:26:56.906 --> 0:26:58.283
I would assume, then,
that you'd be well-versed

0:26:58.366 --> 0:27:00.285
in how our government's
tax system works.

0:27:00.368 --> 0:27:02.037
Taking personal
capital gains

0:27:02.120 --> 0:27:04.247
under the church's
tax shelter...

0:27:04.331 --> 0:27:06.374
that would be fraud,
wouldn't it, Your Excellency?

0:27:07.626 --> 0:27:11.463
I will not be cowed
into forsaking my beliefs.

0:27:12.130 --> 0:27:13.923
Not by you or anyone else.

0:27:15.175 --> 0:27:16.468
Admirable.

0:27:17.344 --> 0:27:18.887
Good day, Excellency.

0:27:19.929 --> 0:27:20.889
Mr. Kellerman...

0:27:22.432 --> 0:27:26.645
What is it about this case
that the Secret Service is so interested in?

0:27:26.728 --> 0:27:28.813
The man killed
the Vice President's brother.

0:27:37.072 --> 0:27:37.947
What'd you say?

0:27:38.031 --> 0:27:39.032
You heard me.

0:27:39.115 --> 0:27:40.700
Someone found Fibonacci.

0:27:40.784 --> 0:27:42.702
I'm looking at the photos
right now.

0:27:42.786 --> 0:27:45.205
Son of a bitch
has got a beard, sunglasses...

0:27:45.288 --> 0:27:46.956
Witness protection,
if I ever saw it.

0:27:47.540 --> 0:27:48.875
Who was this someone?

0:27:48.958 --> 0:27:51.086
Don't know, there's no return address
on the envelope.

0:27:51.920 --> 0:27:54.047
Just...

0:27:54.130 --> 0:27:56.675
this folded-up bird
made of paper.

0:27:59.094 --> 0:28:00.387
Like origami?

0:28:00.470 --> 0:28:01.596
Yeah, like that.

0:28:02.305 --> 0:28:03.598
Like origami.

0:28:37.799 --> 0:28:40.009
You're Charles Westmoreland,
right?

0:28:40.093 --> 0:28:41.136
Do I know you?

0:28:41.219 --> 0:28:43.388
I knew your wife
before she passed.

0:28:43.930 --> 0:28:44.931
You knew Marla?

0:28:45.014 --> 0:28:45.932
You mean Ann?

0:28:46.975 --> 0:28:48.268
How'd you know her?

0:28:48.351 --> 0:28:50.228
We taught together
in Boston.

0:28:50.311 --> 0:28:51.354
East Farmington.

0:28:51.438 --> 0:28:52.647
You mean West Wilmington?

0:28:54.023 --> 0:28:55.316
No more tests.

0:28:55.817 --> 0:28:56.901
I promise.

0:28:58.236 --> 0:28:59.988
Seems you know
everything about me.

0:29:00.697 --> 0:29:01.531
Who are you?

0:29:01.614 --> 0:29:02.490
Michael Scofield.

0:29:03.324 --> 0:29:05.118
How'd you get it in here?

0:29:05.201 --> 0:29:07.328
First off,
she's not an "it."

0:29:07.412 --> 0:29:09.581
She's Marilyn,
and she's grandfathered

0:29:09.664 --> 0:29:13.835
back from the days
when prisoners were allowed a creature comfort or two.

0:29:14.669 --> 0:29:16.212
I heard
you were D.B. Cooper.

0:29:18.214 --> 0:29:20.091
Every new fish
comes in here,

0:29:20.175 --> 0:29:21.301
first thing they hear,

0:29:21.384 --> 0:29:24.262
is that Charles Westmoreland
is D.B. Cooper.

0:29:24.345 --> 0:29:26.139
I'll tell you
like I tell them...

0:29:27.557 --> 0:29:29.434
You want the Cooper story?

0:29:29.517 --> 0:29:32.771
I can't give it to you,
'cause I'm not him.

0:29:32.854 --> 0:29:33.688
It's too bad.

0:29:33.772 --> 0:29:35.523
Sort of wish it was true.

0:29:35.607 --> 0:29:36.941
The man's a legend.

0:29:37.025 --> 0:29:39.944
Nowhere near as much
as I wish it were true, friend.

0:29:40.028 --> 0:29:42.864
I'd have a million-five
waiting for me on the outside.

0:29:45.867 --> 0:29:48.203
I'd put some grass
under 'em if I were you.

0:29:49.579 --> 0:29:52.207
This thing would go
a whole lot easier if you'd just hire me.

0:29:53.208 --> 0:29:54.751
What is this all about?

0:29:55.835 --> 0:29:57.837
Say you were able
to get outside those walls...

0:29:58.755 --> 0:29:59.839
would you have
the people in place

0:29:59.923 --> 0:30:01.966
to make sure
you disappeared forever?

0:30:02.050 --> 0:30:03.009
What do you care?

0:30:03.468 --> 0:30:04.969
Just curious.

0:30:05.053 --> 0:30:06.638
Where's Fibonacci?

0:30:06.721 --> 0:30:08.223
That's not the way
it works.

0:30:12.936 --> 0:30:15.897
They come at me, John,
I'm coming after you.

0:30:17.106 --> 0:30:18.107
I doubt it.

0:30:20.527 --> 0:30:22.111
Fight, fight, fight...

0:30:45.426 --> 0:30:46.928
All right.

0:30:53.142 --> 0:30:54.310
Get on the ground.

0:30:56.938 --> 0:30:58.940
I totally
misjudged you, Scofield.

0:30:59.023 --> 0:31:01.401
I didn't think
you were the agitating type.

0:31:01.484 --> 0:31:04.404
Behavior like that
will not be tolerated in my prison.

0:31:04.487 --> 0:31:05.613
Ninety days in the SHU!

0:31:05.697 --> 0:31:07.699
That ought to be enough time
to convince you of that fact.

0:31:07.782 --> 0:31:08.616
Ninety days?

0:31:08.700 --> 0:31:09.576
That's right.

0:31:17.792 --> 0:31:19.294
Something you want to say?

0:31:20.003 --> 0:31:22.046
It's just...

0:31:22.130 --> 0:31:23.756
I'm not of much value
to you in the SHU.

0:31:24.424 --> 0:31:25.258
Value?

0:31:25.341 --> 0:31:27.385
Hmm... The Taj.

0:31:27.468 --> 0:31:29.470
It'd be a shame
for the eighth wonder of the modern world

0:31:29.554 --> 0:31:32.682
to collapse because the stress
isn't properly propagated.

0:31:32.765 --> 0:31:33.850
Properly propagated?

0:31:33.933 --> 0:31:35.643
Properly propagated.

0:31:35.727 --> 0:31:37.270
The joints are overloaded.

0:31:37.353 --> 0:31:39.647
They won't provide anywhere
near the sheer strength

0:31:39.731 --> 0:31:41.149
the completed structure
will need.

0:31:42.817 --> 0:31:44.319
How much work
are we talking?

0:31:45.028 --> 0:31:46.362
You want it by when, June?

0:31:46.446 --> 0:31:47.488
Yes.

0:31:47.572 --> 0:31:50.158
Then we'd better get started,
wouldn't you say?

0:32:17.393 --> 0:32:18.436
Who's there?

0:32:36.871 --> 0:32:38.831
Bishop McMorrow
was killed last night.

0:32:38.915 --> 0:32:40.541
Someone shot him
while he was sleeping.

0:32:41.876 --> 0:32:43.252
I thought
you'd want to know.

0:32:43.920 --> 0:32:44.796
Thanks.

0:32:52.553 --> 0:32:53.680
Michael was right.

0:33:23.543 --> 0:33:25.128
Sink, you got a visitor.

0:33:37.974 --> 0:33:39.392
He was arrested.

0:33:40.977 --> 0:33:42.186
For what?

0:33:42.270 --> 0:33:43.688
Possession of marijuana.

0:33:46.816 --> 0:33:50.111
I figured he could use
some fatherly advice before it's...

0:33:51.404 --> 0:33:53.614
-Gone forever?
-I didn't mean that.

0:33:53.698 --> 0:33:55.033
I know you didn't.

0:33:55.116 --> 0:33:56.200
Thanks, Lisa.

0:33:57.952 --> 0:33:59.120
Sit down.

0:34:04.292 --> 0:34:05.126
Dope, huh?

0:34:05.793 --> 0:34:07.003
Using or dealing?

0:34:08.629 --> 0:34:09.881
What's the difference?

0:34:09.964 --> 0:34:13.301
Then what, you, uh, think it gives you
some kind of street cred?

0:34:15.303 --> 0:34:16.554
You got a piece
of the good life.

0:34:16.637 --> 0:34:17.638
Take advantage.

0:34:18.973 --> 0:34:20.475
Look, I get it.

0:34:20.558 --> 0:34:22.143
The whole thing.

0:34:22.226 --> 0:34:24.145
She drags me in here,

0:34:24.228 --> 0:34:25.605
you give me a big speech,

0:34:25.688 --> 0:34:27.690
I walk away a changed man.

0:34:27.774 --> 0:34:29.025
Straight A's.

0:34:29.108 --> 0:34:31.944
Harvard.
Grow up and be a dentist.

0:34:32.028 --> 0:34:33.279
It's better than being here.

0:34:35.865 --> 0:34:37.075
You got to realize
who's getting punished

0:34:37.158 --> 0:34:38.910
when you're doing
the things you're doing.

0:34:38.993 --> 0:34:40.745
You think it's me.
It's you.

0:34:40.828 --> 0:34:42.205
I did the same thing.

0:34:42.288 --> 0:34:43.748
Punished the old man
'cause he was gone.

0:34:43.831 --> 0:34:44.749
Look what it got me.

0:34:49.003 --> 0:34:51.380
I'm not asking you
to love me.

0:34:51.464 --> 0:34:54.383
I already screwed up
that chance long ago.

0:34:54.467 --> 0:34:56.677
I'm asking you
to love yourself.

0:34:56.761 --> 0:34:58.679
You can still put the brakes
on this thing.

0:35:01.057 --> 0:35:03.017
So, that's what
fatherly advice is like.

0:35:04.477 --> 0:35:05.520
Where are you going?

0:35:06.729 --> 0:35:08.064
I got homework.

0:35:09.023 --> 0:35:11.067
They're putting me
to death, LJ.

0:35:11.150 --> 0:35:12.735
In a month's time,
I'll be dead.

0:35:13.861 --> 0:35:14.737
You get that?

0:35:15.822 --> 0:35:18.199
You're already
dead to me.

0:35:43.975 --> 0:35:45.518
Yes.

0:35:45.601 --> 0:35:48.521
What? You mean "yes," yes?

0:35:48.604 --> 0:35:49.647
Yes!

0:35:49.730 --> 0:35:51.023
- Yeah!
- Yes!

0:35:53.484 --> 0:35:55.570
-Oh, there's just one thing.
-Of course.

0:35:55.653 --> 0:35:57.029
Mama wants us to wait
till you get out.

0:35:57.113 --> 0:35:58.197
Of course, mi amor.

0:35:58.281 --> 0:35:59.490
Oh, and we have
to get married in a church.

0:35:59.574 --> 0:36:01.659
-Okay. Esta bien.
-A Catholic church.

0:36:01.742 --> 0:36:03.953
Wouldn't want to mess
with the Catholic roots, would we?

0:36:10.751 --> 0:36:11.836
You went to Loyola.

0:36:11.919 --> 0:36:13.337
You've been
checking up on me.

0:36:13.421 --> 0:36:15.256
I like to get to know
my patients.

0:36:15.339 --> 0:36:17.341
I went to Northwestern.
Graduated two years after you did.

0:36:17.425 --> 0:36:19.969
Maybe we met before,
you know, drunk,

0:36:20.052 --> 0:36:21.429
out at a bar somewhere.

0:36:21.512 --> 0:36:22.597
I would have remembered.

0:36:22.680 --> 0:36:24.265
-That a compliment?
-No.

0:36:25.725 --> 0:36:26.601
Hmm.

0:36:27.894 --> 0:36:29.020
What?

0:36:29.103 --> 0:36:31.772
Your blood glucose is at
50 milligrams per deciliter.

0:36:31.856 --> 0:36:33.900
-So?
-That's hypoglycemic.

0:36:33.983 --> 0:36:35.526
Your body's reacting
to the insulin

0:36:35.610 --> 0:36:36.694
like you're not a diabetic.

0:36:36.777 --> 0:36:38.779
You're sure it's type 1 diabetes
you've got?

0:36:38.863 --> 0:36:40.156
Ever since I was a kid.

0:36:41.449 --> 0:36:42.533
All right.

0:36:42.617 --> 0:36:44.368
Not experiencing
any tingling sensation, cold sweats--

0:36:48.873 --> 0:36:50.124
Infirmary.

0:36:50.374 --> 0:36:51.417
Yes.

0:36:52.752 --> 0:36:54.420
Yeah. I did.

0:36:55.796 --> 0:36:58.633
No, I did and I do.
I need them.

0:36:58.716 --> 0:37:02.386
Okay. Um, great.
Well, I'll call him after lunch, then.

0:37:02.470 --> 0:37:04.347
Thanks.
I'm with a patient. Okay.

0:37:05.556 --> 0:37:07.808
I'd like to run some tests
next time you're in.

0:37:07.892 --> 0:37:11.145
Last thing I want is to be
administering insulin to a man who doesn't need it.

0:37:11.604 --> 0:37:13.064
Yeah, sure.

0:37:13.773 --> 0:37:15.024
Okay.

0:37:21.739 --> 0:37:23.199
How'd you get here,
by the way?

0:37:23.658 --> 0:37:25.159
Oh, you know.

0:37:26.160 --> 0:37:27.745
I don't.
That's why I asked.

0:37:27.828 --> 0:37:30.414
You know. Hector.

0:37:30.498 --> 0:37:31.415
What?

0:37:31.499 --> 0:37:33.125
I didn't have any money
for the bus,

0:37:33.209 --> 0:37:34.585
so he offered me a ride.

0:37:35.044 --> 0:37:36.420
He was really sweet.

0:37:38.339 --> 0:37:39.966
Honey, he's just a friend.

0:37:40.049 --> 0:37:41.050
No, he's not
just a friend.

0:37:41.133 --> 0:37:43.010
I know Hector.
I know men.

0:37:43.094 --> 0:37:44.303
Men and women
can't be friends.

0:37:44.387 --> 0:37:47.139
A guy doesn't drive a girl
500 miles across state lines

0:37:47.223 --> 0:37:48.349
because he wants
to be friends.

0:37:48.432 --> 0:37:50.393
Casanova, wrap it up.

0:37:51.560 --> 0:37:55.147
Hey, you got nothing
to worry about, okay?

0:37:55.231 --> 0:37:57.275
It's you I'm marrying.

0:37:57.358 --> 0:37:59.110
It's not you
I'm worried about.

0:38:01.737 --> 0:38:03.197
Sixteen more months.

0:38:12.039 --> 0:38:13.332
I love you.

0:38:24.969 --> 0:38:27.054
Be easy, son, all right?

0:38:32.935 --> 0:38:35.062
Sucre tells me
you're the local pharmacy.

0:38:39.150 --> 0:38:41.277
-What you need, man?
-PUGNAc.

0:38:41.360 --> 0:38:43.529
I only speak English,
white boy.

0:38:43.612 --> 0:38:44.822
It's an insulin blocker.

0:38:44.905 --> 0:38:46.532
Standard
over-the-counter variety.

0:38:46.615 --> 0:38:47.700
You can get it
at any pharmacy.

0:38:47.783 --> 0:38:49.118
You can get that
at medical then.

0:38:49.201 --> 0:38:50.578
I can't get it at medical.

0:38:51.370 --> 0:38:52.288
Why not?

0:38:52.371 --> 0:38:54.415
Because they're already
giving me insulin shots.

0:38:56.250 --> 0:38:58.836
You're one mixed-up cracker,
you know that?

0:38:58.919 --> 0:39:00.296
Can you get it for me,
or not?

0:39:01.255 --> 0:39:03.215
Only if you tell me
why is it you want

0:39:03.299 --> 0:39:04.508
to keep going
back up to medical

0:39:04.592 --> 0:39:06.510
to get an insulin shot
for which you don't need.

0:39:07.136 --> 0:39:08.721
I like the ambiance.

0:39:08.804 --> 0:39:09.972
Uh-huh.

0:39:10.514 --> 0:39:11.724
Are we in business?

0:39:17.480 --> 0:39:18.731
All personnel,

0:39:18.814 --> 0:39:21.025
Facility Two lockdown
in 20 minutes.

0:39:21.108 --> 0:39:24.070
Facility One lockdown
in ten minutes.

0:39:27.531 --> 0:39:29.742
Scofield. I don't know
what you did,

0:39:29.825 --> 0:39:32.244
but Abruzzi wanted me
to give you this P.I. card.

0:39:32.995 --> 0:39:33.954
Congratulations.

0:39:34.038 --> 0:39:36.082
You just joined the ranks
of the employed.

0:39:52.556 --> 0:39:54.016
Kudos, Fish.

0:39:54.600 --> 0:39:56.018
You got spine.

0:40:01.857 --> 0:40:04.026
All right, cons,
break it down!

0:40:06.445 --> 0:40:07.738
Move it, guys.

0:40:20.042 --> 0:40:22.128
Saw Veronica
came by yesterday.

0:40:22.211 --> 0:40:23.337
Still engaged to that guy?

0:40:23.421 --> 0:40:24.296
Yup.

0:40:25.047 --> 0:40:25.965
Could have been me.

0:40:26.048 --> 0:40:27.550
If you hadn't
self-destructed.

0:40:28.926 --> 0:40:30.886
You think I meant
to knock up Lisa Rix?

0:40:31.637 --> 0:40:32.847
I was just being stupid.

0:40:33.097 --> 0:40:34.098
Hurt.

0:40:35.558 --> 0:40:37.101
Shouldn't have
pushed her away, though.

0:40:37.184 --> 0:40:38.310
You pushed everyone away.

0:40:40.062 --> 0:40:41.480
I'm an anchor.

0:40:41.564 --> 0:40:43.274
All I'll do
is drag him down with me.

0:40:48.737 --> 0:40:50.281
Why did you hire him?

0:40:50.364 --> 0:40:51.740
Keep your friends close

0:40:51.824 --> 0:40:53.826
and your enemies closer.

0:40:59.331 --> 0:41:00.583
You mean
what you said earlier?

0:41:00.666 --> 0:41:02.793
I'm not here on vacation,
trust me.

0:41:04.253 --> 0:41:06.755
Getting outside these walls,
that's just the beginning.

0:41:07.423 --> 0:41:08.799
You're going to need money.

0:41:12.261 --> 0:41:13.888
I'll have it.

0:41:13.971 --> 0:41:15.681
And people
on the outside...

0:41:15.764 --> 0:41:17.308
People that can
help you disappear.

0:41:18.142 --> 0:41:19.518
I've already got them.

0:41:20.436 --> 0:41:21.896
They just
don't know it yet.

0:41:27.276 --> 0:41:29.195
Look, whatever you got
going on, fill me in,

0:41:29.278 --> 0:41:30.321
'cause I'm in the dark here.

0:41:32.448 --> 0:41:34.325
Chaparral Associates
got the contract

0:41:34.408 --> 0:41:36.118
to retrofit
this place in '99.

0:41:36.202 --> 0:41:37.536
Four million dollar contract.

0:41:37.620 --> 0:41:39.205
Head partner
couldn't crack it.

0:41:39.288 --> 0:41:42.333
So, he subcontracted out,
an under-the-table sort of deal

0:41:42.416 --> 0:41:43.584
with a former associate.

0:41:43.667 --> 0:41:46.253
That guy was one
of the partners in my firm.

0:41:48.589 --> 0:41:50.090
We basically ghost-wrote
the whole plan.

0:41:50.174 --> 0:41:52.885
Crossed the t's, dotted the i's,
grouted the tiles.

0:42:02.645 --> 0:42:03.896
You've seen the blueprints.

0:42:03.979 --> 0:42:05.022
Better than that.

0:42:06.565 --> 0:42:07.900
I've got them on me.

0:42:12.321 --> 0:42:13.572
Are you kidding me?

0:42:16.992 --> 0:42:19.078
Am I supposed to be seeing
something here?

0:42:19.161 --> 0:42:20.287
Look closer.

0:43:37.364 --> 0:43:39.158
Captioned by Point.360.
