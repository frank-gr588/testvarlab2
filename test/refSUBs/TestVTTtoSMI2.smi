<SYNC Start=25900 End=27068><P>That's it.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=28903 End=31698><P>Can I just, you know,
look at it for a minute?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=33158 End=34701><P>You're an artist, Sid.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=37120 End=39122><P>You're telling me
you're just gonna walk out of here</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=39205 End=41166><P>and I'm never going
to see it again?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=41249 End=42792><P>There's a good chance
of that, yes.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=44210 End=45879><P>Most guys, you know,
for the first one,</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=45962 End=47589><P>they start
with something small.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=47672 End=50258><P>"Mom," girlfriend's initials,
something like that.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=50925 End=53219><P>Not you.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=53303 End=56514><P>You get a full set of sleeves,
all in a couple of months.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=56598 End=58933><P>Takes guys a few years
to get the ink you got.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=60310 End=62062><P>I don't have
a few years.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=63646 End=65398><P>Wish to hell I did.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=119536 End=120829><P>The vault. Open it.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=120912 End=122997><P>We can't. The branch
manager's not here.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=125208 End=126876><P>-Where is he?
-It's lunchtime.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=126960 End=128044><P>He's at White Castle.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=128461 End=129337><P>White Castle?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=129420 End=130463><P>It's a fast food restaurant.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=130547 End=133508><P>They serve
those little square burgers.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=134050 End=135301><P>I know what it is.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=137762 End=139055><P>I'm not playing games.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=139430 End=140557><P>Open it.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=140640 End=142809><P>Sir, you have a half
a million dollars cash in your bag.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=142892 End=144727><P>Don't you think
it would be better...</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=155572 End=157240><P>This is the police.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=157323 End=159659><P>You are completely surrounded.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=161911 End=163246><P>Put down your weapon.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=165665 End=167667><P>Put down your weapons now.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=172046 End=173840><P>Rarely in the case
of armed robbery</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=173923 End=175925><P>do we hear a plea
of no contest.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=176009 End=178052><P>Are you sure about this,
Mr. Scofield?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=178136 End=179637><P>I'm sure, Your Honor.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=179721 End=181848><P>Your Honor, we'd like
to recess if we could.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=181931 End=183766><P>My client's a bit confused
at the moment.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=183850 End=184684><P>I'm not, Your Honor.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=184767 End=186060><P>He is, Your Honor.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=186144 End=188563><P>Perhaps you should heed
your representation's advice,</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=188646 End=191274><P>take some additional time
to consider your response.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=191357 End=192650><P>I've already done that,
Your Honor.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=199199 End=201868><P>I'll retire to my chambers
to determine sentencing.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=201951 End=203786><P>Court's recessed until 1:30.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=206122 End=207040><P>Come on, let's go.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=207123 End=208166><P>Uncle Mike?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=210627 End=212003><P>I didn't want you to come.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=212629 End=214297><P>Go home, LJ.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=214589 End=216299><P>I didn't want you
to see this.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=223890 End=225058><P>He's not gonna
take this well.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=225141 End=227018><P>Can you blame him?
He's your nephew.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=227101 End=228102><P>He's beginning
to get the idea</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=228186 End=229729><P>that anybody
he attaches himself to</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=229812 End=231648><P>is gonna
end up in prison...</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=231731 End=232649><P>And he's not the only one</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=232732 End=234108><P>who's starting to feel
that way, Michael.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=235985 End=237403><P>Will you give us a minute?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=237487 End=238446><P>One minute.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=239155 End=240782><P>Don't you understand?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=240865 End=242367><P>You just put the book
in that woman's hand</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=242450 End=244577><P>and she's gonna lob it
at you like a grenade.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=244661 End=247121><P>Justice and punishment
are the same thing to her.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=247413 End=248539><P>I know.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=248623 End=250917><P>Then will you please tell me
what's going through your head?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=251000 End=252043><P>We've been over this.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=252126 End=253419><P>I've known you
my entire life.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=253503 End=255838><P>You don't have
a violent bone in your body,</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=255922 End=257799><P>and I know you didn't
need the money.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=257882 End=258758><P>Veronica.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=258841 End=260760><P>Why won't you
let me help you?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=260843 End=262053><P>You've been good to me.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=262136 End=263763><P>My whole life, you have.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=264931 End=266349><P>But you've gotta let me
deal with this.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=266683 End=268434><P>Okay?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=268977 End=270770><P>Given your lack
of prior criminal conduct,</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=271396 End=273940><P>I am inclined
toward probation.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=274023 End=276150><P>However, the fact that
you discharged a deadly weapon</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=276234 End=279112><P>during the commission
of the crime suggests malice to me.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=279195 End=281364><P>For that reason,
I find it incumbent</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=281447 End=284242><P>that you see the inside
of a prison cell, Mr. Scofield.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=285368 End=287954><P>It says here
that you've requested to be incarcerated</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=288037 End=290123><P>somewhere near your home
here in Chicago.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=290206 End=291791><P>I'm willing to honor that.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=291874 End=293376><P>The closest
level one facility to--</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=293459 End=294294><P>Level one?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=294377 End=296254><P>That's maximum security,
Your Honor.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=296337 End=299590><P>I would ask counsel to refrain
from interrupting me.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=299674 End=300633><P>As I was saying,</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=300717 End=302135><P>the closest
level one facility</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=302218 End=304220><P>would be Fox River
State Penitentiary.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=304304 End=305888><P>As for the term
of your sentence,</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=305972 End=307473><P>I'm setting it
at five years.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=307557 End=309976><P>You'll be eligible for parole
in half that time.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=310059 End=312437><P>Sentence to be carried out immediately.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=325575 End=328119><P>Okay, step inside the door
and check yourself for bugs.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=328202 End=329662><P>When you hear
the knock, step out.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=329746 End=331039><P>Keep the line moving.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=331122 End=333166><P>We ain't got all day
to get this done.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=333249 End=334667><P>- Let's go. Move it.
- No more talking in line.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=334751 End=336794><P>Move it. You got less
than five minutes to take a shower.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=336878 End=338421><P>Keep the line moving.
Keep it moving.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=338504 End=341049><P>- Move it. Right now. Let's go. Move, move.
- Next!</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=344218 End=345553><P>Name and back number.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=345636 End=346888><P>Scofield, Michael.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=346971 End=347930><P>94941.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=348014 End=349557><P>Are you
a religious man, Scofield?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=349640 End=350641><P>Never really
thought about it.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=350725 End=351726><P>Good, 'cause
the Ten Commandments</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=351809 End=352935><P>don't mean
a box of piss in here.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=353019 End=354145><P>We got two commandments
and two only.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=354228 End=356898><P>The first commandment
is you got nothing coming.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=356981 End=358358><P>What's the second commandment?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=358441 End=359525><P>See commandment number one.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=359609 End=361152><P>Gotcha.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=362445 End=363988><P>You talking out the side
of your neck?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=364530 End=365573><P>Come again?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=365656 End=368576><P>I said, are you
being a smartass?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=368659 End=371079><P>Just trying to fly low,
avoid the radar, boss.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=371162 End=372955><P>Do my time... and get out.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=374332 End=376125><P>There isn't any flying
under my radar.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=377126 End=378127><P>Good to know.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=399315 End=401609><P>Hey, can a brother
get some air conditioning up here, cuz?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=401692 End=403778><P>It's hotter than
a crack ho's mouth, man.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=403861 End=406197><P>To hell with the AC, man.
Give me the crack ho.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=409659 End=410910><P>Come on!</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=414205 End=415248><P>Yo, Fish!</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=415331 End=416707><P>What you looking at?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=416791 End=418835><P>You look kind of pretty
to be up in here, man.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=419836 End=420711><P>Fish!</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=422463 End=423965><P>I suggest you
take a seat, Fish.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=425508 End=427885><P>Ain't nothing to do up in here
but serve time.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=427969 End=429929><P>Ain't nobody
gonna serve it for you.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=445695 End=447238><P>Welcome to
Prisneyland, Fish.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=454912 End=456747><P>...is now
on mandatory lockdown...</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=474182 End=475975><P>You wanna talk
about it?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=476058 End=477685><P>No, it's not
worth talking about.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=477768 End=480021><P>If it's keeping you up,
it is.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=480104 End=481689><P>Oh, it's just...</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=481772 End=483733><P>It's nothing, you know.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=484942 End=485943><P>Michael's case.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=487111 End=488529><P>You did the best you could.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=488613 End=490114><P>Yeah, but he didn't.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=491491 End=492408><P>He just sort of rolled over.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=492492 End=494118><P>He didn't put up a fight.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=494202 End=495077><P>It's not like him.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=497205 End=499290><P>I'm sorry. I shouldn't
be talking about him.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=499373 End=502293><P>Hey, if it's on your mind,
it's on your mind, right?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=504378 End=505671><P>Good night.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=514972 End=517266><P>All wings, guard coming out.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=517350 End=519310><P>All wings,
guard coming out.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=523814 End=525149><P>Trey Street Deuces
got the hoops.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=525858 End=527652><P>Nortenos got the bleachers.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=528319 End=529779><P>Woods got the weight pile.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=531072 End=532657><P>The C.O.s got the rest.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=532740 End=536452><P>I'm telling you, the guards
are the dirtiest gang in this whole place.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=536536 End=538329><P>The only difference
between us and them...</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=538412 End=539997><P>is the badge.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=540081 End=541040><P>Who's the pet lover?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=541123 End=542917><P>He'll deny it,
but he's D.B. Cooper.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=543000 End=547088><P>Parachuted out of a plane
30 years ago with a million and a half in cash.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=547171 End=548839><P>Doesn't look
like the type.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=548923 End=549924><P>Who does?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=550007 End=552176><P>Hey! What up, Wholesale?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=552260 End=553928><P>-You okay?
-Gonna be greater later.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=554011 End=554845><P>Yeah.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=554929 End=556472><P>What you doing
with this fish, man?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=556556 End=557974><P>-He's my new cellie.
-Huh.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=558057 End=560935><P>Wholesale's got it wired up
at the commissary.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=561018 End=562812><P>Anything you want,
he can get it for you.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=562895 End=564272><P>You keep
handing out my jacket,</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=564355 End=565731><P>I swear I'm gonna
bust your grape.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=565815 End=567775><P>Man, you couldn't bust a grape in Napa
with a set of cleats on.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=567858 End=569694><P>-What are you talking about?
-Man, you want to bump your gums.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=569777 End=571904><P>Oh, no, no. Now you're
talking, talking, talking...</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=599765 End=601350><P>I'm looking for someone.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=603019 End=604687><P>Guy named Lincoln Burrows.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=604770 End=606105><P>Linc the Sink?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=606188 End=607607><P>That what
they're calling him now?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=608024 End=609275><P>Yeah.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=609358 End=611277><P>As in, he'll come at you
with everything but the kitchen...</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=611360 End=612486><P>Snowflake.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=612570 End=613988><P>Where can I find him?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=615448 End=617533><P>Man killed
the Vice President's brother.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=617617 End=619035><P>In a month,
he's getting the chair,</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=619118 End=621787><P>which means no one up this river
is more dangerous than him,</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=621871 End=623205><P>'cause he's got
nothing to lose now.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=623289 End=625458><P>What are they gonna do?
Kill him twice?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=625541 End=626417><P>There a way
I can get to him?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=626500 End=628336><P>Oh, no. The only time
those boys get out</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=628419 End=629879><P>is for chapel and P.I.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=630546 End=632173><P>P.I.? What's that?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=632256 End=633174><P>Prison Industry.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=633257 End=634967><P>The guys that get along
get to work.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=635051 End=639513><P>You know, painting, scrapping,
making mattresses, you name it.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=639597 End=641682><P>I wouldn't get excited, though,
if I were you, Fish.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=641766 End=643225><P>You ain't sniffin'
none of P.I.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=643559 End=644685><P>Why's that?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=644769 End=646354><P>'Cause John Abruzzi runs it.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=647188 End=648814><P>"John Abruzzi" John Abruzzi?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=648898 End=651108><P>"John Abruzzi" John Abruzzi.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=651192 End=653277><P>Why you wanna see Burrows
so bad anyhow?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=657114 End=658574><P>Because he's my brother.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=681806 End=682807><P>They denied the motion.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=682890 End=683808><P>Then do it again.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=683891 End=684850><P>I can't. That's it.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=684934 End=687019><P>May 11th.
That's the date, man.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=687103 End=688604><P>That's the date they,
uh, you know...</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=689271 End=690356><P>execute me.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=690856 End=692108><P>I know.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=697780 End=699657><P>I didn't
kill that man, Michael.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=699740 End=701117><P>The evidence says you did.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=701200 End=702660><P>I don't care
what the evidence says.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=702743 End=703619><P>I didn't kill him.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=704787 End=706080><P>Swear to me.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=708124 End=709542><P>I swear to you, Michael.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=715297 End=717925><P>But how did they get it wrong then?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=718008 End=719468><P>The courts,
the appeals.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=719552 End=721929><P>Don't know. Don't know.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=722012 End=723889><P>All I keep thinking,
looking back on it is, uh...</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=723973 End=725015><P>I was set up.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=726308 End=727393><P>And whoever it was
that set me up</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=727476 End=729562><P>wants me in the ground
as quickly as possible.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=735151 End=736861><P>What's another word
for "love"?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=736944 End=738237><P>What's the context?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=738320 End=739572><P>Oh, you know.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=739655 End=740990><P>The "I love you so much</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=741073 End=743826><P>I ain't never knocking over
a liquor store again" context.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=743909 End=745327><P>Except, you know, classy.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=745619 End=747246><P>Mmm.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=747329 End=749206><P>I'm proposing to my girl,
if you gotta know.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=749665 End=750583><P>In a letter?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=750666 End=751500><P>You got a better way?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=751584 End=753294><P>Face-to-face
works pretty good.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=753377 End=756505><P>This place ain't exactly
the romantic spot.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=756589 End=758924><P>I'm gonna have her get
on the Staten Island Ferry.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=759008 End=761552><P>Then, once she can see
the Empire State Building,</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=761635 End=762928><P>she opens the letter...</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=763012 End=765097><P>It's like almost being there.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=765181 End=766891><P>Except for the fact
that I won't be there.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=768225 End=769143><P>Try "passion."</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=769226 End=771103><P>Ooh! Ooh! "Passion."
"Passion." That's dope.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=771854 End=773022><P>Passion.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=774690 End=775775><P>How do you spell that?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=775858 End=777610><P>-Is it P-A-S-H?
-Uh-uh.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=779403 End=780404><P>No "H"?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=786827 End=788287><P>LJ, hold up.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=788370 End=789955><P>Hold up.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=790039 End=792041><P>I don't think I can
go through with this.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=792124 End=793542><P>Everything's going
to be fine.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=794543 End=795753><P>Trust me.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=805930 End=807139><P>We understand
each other, then?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=807223 End=808224><P>-Yeah.
-Friday.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=808307 End=810559><P>Not Saturday.
Not Sunday. Friday.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=810643 End=812144><P>It's totally understood.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=812228 End=813896><P>I don't want hundreds,
I don't want fives, I don't want ones.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=813979 End=814897><P>I know, I know.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=814980 End=816148><P>Tens and 20s only.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=825783 End=827535><P>It's on.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=840381 End=841674><P>Police!</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=864822 End=867283><P>Abruzzi, I need you
to hire me a P.I.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=869326 End=871078><P>Beat it.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=871161 End=872997><P>Maybe you ought to hear
what I got to say.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=873080 End=874540><P>You got nothing I need.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=877167 End=878544><P>Wouldn't be
too sure of that.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=879837 End=881171><P>My mistake.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=882131 End=885092><P>Just what I need... a duck.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=886051 End=887428><P>P.I., Abruzzi.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=887511 End=890139><P>You might find I can be
of more assistance than you think.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=893100 End=894310><P>Mull it over.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=895561 End=897271><P>Come find me
when you're ready to talk.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=904778 End=906780><P>All right, guys,
pick it up!</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=906864 End=908324><P>I want to get home tonight!</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=908616 End=909700><P>Maggio.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=916874 End=918042><P>Yeah? So?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=918125 End=919752><P>That's the son of a bitch
that fingered Abruzzi.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=921003 End=922171><P>That's Fibonacci?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=923505 End=925716><P>I thought the punk
was gone forever.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=925799 End=927718><P>Evidently,
somebody found him.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=927801 End=929803><P>Somebody messing with us?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=929887 End=931430><P>This you're not
going to believe.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=935392 End=936477><P>What is it?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=941482 End=943817><P>Tattoo looks fresh.
Hold that.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=945235 End=947571><P>I guess, being a diabetic,
you don't mind needles.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=948280 End=949990><P>I'm Michael, by the way.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=950074 End=951784><P>Scofield.
I read your report.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=952576 End=953994><P>And you are?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=954078 End=955871><P>Dr. Tancredi will do.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=955955 End=957331><P>"Tancredi" like the governor?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=959416 End=960793><P>You're not related,
are you?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=962378 End=964838><P>Hmm. Wouldn't think
you'd find the daughter</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=964922 End=967424><P>of Frontier Justice Frank
working in a prison.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=968175 End=970177><P>As a doctor, no less.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=970260 End=973305><P>I believe in being part
of the solution, not the problem.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=973389 End=977601><P>Hmm. "Be the change you want
to see in the world."</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=981563 End=982439><P>What?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=984191 End=986110><P>Nothing. That was just
my senior quote.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=986652 End=987653><P>That was you?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=987736 End=989697><P>This whole time,
I was thinking it was Gandhi.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=989780 End=992366><P>You're very funny.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=992449 End=994493><P>Sit tight.
Put direct pressure on that.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=994576 End=995619><P>I'll be back
in a sec.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1010801 End=1011885><P>So, how do we play this?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1011969 End=1014096><P>You hook me up
with a few weeks' supply?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1014179 End=1016724><P>Nice try.
No hypos on the floor.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1016807 End=1019852><P>I'm the farthest thing
from a junkie. Trust me.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1019935 End=1021228><P>I got news
for you, Michael.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1021311 End=1023564><P>"Trust me" means absolutely zero
inside these walls.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1023647 End=1025149><P>The only way
you're getting that insulin</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1025232 End=1027276><P>is if I'm administering it.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1027359 End=1029570><P>Guess we'll be seeing
a lot of each other, then, huh?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1030446 End=1031447><P>I guess so.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1044460 End=1046628><P>We're all clear
on the Burrows execution.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1046712 End=1048338><P>-Good.
-Except for one thing.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1048422 End=1050632><P>Bishop McMorrow
is not in the fold.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1053343 End=1055888><P>He's got a lot of influence
with the governor.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1055971 End=1057806><P>They went to prep school
together, apparently.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1059141 End=1062102><P>Look, the closer it gets,
the more I'm worried</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1062186 End=1064396><P>that the bottom is going
to fall out of this whole thing.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1068859 End=1071528><P>Well, maybe it's time you arranged a visit
with the good bishop, then.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1073572 End=1077743><P>Look, in one month,
it'll all be over.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1077826 End=1082206><P>"The Son of Man must be delivered
into the hands of sinful men</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1082289 End=1086168><P>and be crucified
and the third day, rise again."</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1086251 End=1090047><P>And they remembered His words,
and so should you.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1090130 End=1092299><P>Good day, gentlemen.
May God be with you.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1097554 End=1099389><P>Let's go,
let's go, let's go.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1104812 End=1106063><P>Michael.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1108690 End=1110818><P>Let's go. Come on, man.
Keep moving.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1110901 End=1112236><P>Keep moving.
Move. Come on.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1112319 End=1114154><P>- Why?
- Let's go, man. Come on.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1114238 End=1116156><P>I'm getting you
out of here.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1116240 End=1118408><P>Burrows, roll it up.
Happy hour's over.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1119743 End=1120994><P>It's impossible.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1121078 End=1122663><P>Not if you designed
the place, it isn't.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1131588 End=1132589><P>Too formal.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1135592 End=1137177><P>Too "greeting card."</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1137261 End=1138679><P>Well, we got
to make a decision</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1138762 End=1140347><P>sooner or later,
you know.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1140430 End=1141306><P>We have time.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1141390 End=1144268><P>We don't, actually.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1144351 End=1147771><P>I mean, at some point,
we got to pull the trigger on this thing.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1147855 End=1149356><P>I don't want
to rush this.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1149439 End=1150649><P>We're only going
to do it once.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1150732 End=1151733><P>We have to
get it right.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1157406 End=1160284><P>Honey, can I
ask you something?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1160367 End=1161285><P>Of course.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1162286 End=1163704><P>Are you putting this off?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1163787 End=1165038><P>What do you mean?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1165122 End=1167040><P>I mean, are you
having second thoughts?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1167666 End=1170085><P>No. Honey, no.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1170711 End=1171670><P>I'm not.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1172504 End=1173714><P>I don't know.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1173797 End=1176133><P>-I just can't help thinking this is about--
-It's not.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1177968 End=1179136><P>I love you.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1180137 End=1181722><P>And I want
to be your wife.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1185976 End=1187144><P>Passion?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1187227 End=1188228><P>What were you thinking?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1188312 End=1189396><P>Hey, you went for it.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1189479 End=1191565><P>She probably thinks
I went sissy up in here.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1191648 End=1196111><P>"Passion." You know,
got more than one syllable, too much talkin'.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1196195 End=1198322><P>That's me from now on.
One-syllable Sucre.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1198405 End=1200574><P>Yes. No. Love.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1200657 End=1202075><P>Hate. Love.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1202159 End=1203410><P>Give it time.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1203493 End=1204745><P>Are you kidding?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1204828 End=1206121><P>I proposed to her.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1206205 End=1207581><P>That doesn't take time.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1207664 End=1208916><P>Si or no.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1208999 End=1210083><P>One syllable, man.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1213503 End=1214504><P>She's supposed
to come around</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1214588 End=1216173><P>for a conjugal on Tuesday.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1216256 End=1217633><P>She's always
calling me beforehand,</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1217716 End=1219718><P>letting me know
she's coming.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1219801 End=1222346><P>This time, man,
I ain't heard a peep.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1223639 End=1224848><P>You spooked her.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1225849 End=1226934><P>Scofield.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1227017 End=1229228><P>Get it together.
Pope wants to see you.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1233523 End=1235025><P>No good, Fish.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1235108 End=1237152><P>No one gets an audience
with the Pope.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1237236 End=1239988><P>Not unless he's real interested
in what you got going on.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1241198 End=1243408><P>Top of your class at Loyola.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1243492 End=1246453><P>Magna cum laude, in fact.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1246536 End=1249373><P>I can't help wondering
what someone with your credentials</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1249456 End=1251041><P>is doing in a place like this.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1252376 End=1255128><P>Took a wrong turn
a few months back, I guess.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1255212 End=1257256><P>You make it sound
like a traffic infraction.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1257339 End=1260509><P>Like all you did was turn the wrong way
up a one-way street.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1260592 End=1262719><P>Everyone turns up one
sooner or later.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1265931 End=1268642><P>The reason
I called you here...</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1268725 End=1271645><P>I noticed in your I-file,
under occupation,</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1271728 End=1273772><P>you put down "unemployed."</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1274523 End=1275983><P>That's not true, now, is it?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1279111 End=1282322><P>I know you're
a structural engineer, Scofield.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1285534 End=1288078><P>Shah Jahan
built the Taj Majal</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1288161 End=1291832><P>as a monument
to his undying love for his wife.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1291915 End=1294668><P>My wife is quite fond
of the story.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1294751 End=1296753><P>It appeals
to the romantic in her.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1298964 End=1302676><P>Being married to someone
in Corrections, terrible job.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1302759 End=1304219><P>Wouldn't wish it on anyone.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1304761 End=1307097><P>And yet, in 39 years,</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1307180 End=1309808><P>my wife
has never complained.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1309891 End=1312227><P>And the worst part of it is,
I've never thanked her.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1314730 End=1317149><P>So, because
I couldn't say it,</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1317232 End=1319318><P>I thought, you know,
I could build it.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1320819 End=1323405><P>Come June,
it's our 40th anniversary.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1325741 End=1327534><P>But here, look.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1327617 End=1328994><P>You see,
the problem is,</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1329536 End=1331079><P>I build anymore,</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1331163 End=1334207><P>it's all gonna come down
like a house of cards.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1334291 End=1337377><P>That's where I was hoping
you could be of assistance.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1337461 End=1338837><P>For the favor,
I can offer you</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1338920 End=1341631><P>three days of work
a week in here.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1341715 End=1343675><P>And it'll keep you
off the yard.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1346595 End=1347846><P>Mmm.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1350766 End=1351975><P>I can't do it.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1353977 End=1357397><P>Son, it's better for me
to owe you one in here</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1357481 End=1358774><P>than it is for you
to owe me one,</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1358857 End=1360317><P>I can promise you that.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1360984 End=1362319><P>I'll take my chances.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1365447 End=1366782><P>Then we're through here.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1367991 End=1369117><P>Guard!</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1371953 End=1374247><P>Two pounds of pot?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1374331 End=1375957><P>What were you trying to do,
set a record?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1376625 End=1378043><P>It's not funny, LJ.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1378126 End=1379669><P>You could be going
to jail.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1381129 End=1383673><P>It's pretty obvious to me
you need some guidance.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1385884 End=1386802><P>Hey.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1387677 End=1388678><P>Thanks.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1391181 End=1392349><P>From who,
old Daddy Warbucks?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1392432 End=1394309><P>Give him a chance.
He's a good man.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1394393 End=1396311><P>We got nothing in common.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1396395 End=1398688><P>Come on. Where is this
coming from, LJ?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1398772 End=1401650><P>Last semester you were getting
almost all A's and now...</P></SYNC>

<SYNC Start=1410283 End=1411493><P>Trust me.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1414579 End=1416373><P>Maybe it's time
we went and saw him.</P></SYNC>

<SYNC Start=1425090 End=1426425><P>You have got
too much potential</P></SYNC>

your life like this.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1432389 End=1436435><P>What if they'd sent you
to Taylorville or Marion and not here?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1436518 End=1439020><P>I think I'd be doing
the same thing I'm doing in here.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1439104 End=1441273><P>Eating Jell-O,
drinking Kool-Aid...</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1441356 End=1443024><P>I know what you're doing.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1443108 End=1445652><P>It's not the luck of the draw

to keep you off the streets,</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1455537 End=1457831><P>so you get yourself tossed

<SYNC Start=1458540 End=1459666><P>To what?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1459749 End=1460834><P>Save him?</P></SYNC>

Not me.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1469551 End=1472596><P>I gave him a shot

<SYNC Start=1474431 End=1476141><P>I did everything I could
to make it work.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1476224 End=1477434><P>And he threw it away.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1477517 End=1479144><P>You ever think maybe he was hurt
that you left</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1479227 End=1480353><P>in the first place?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1481396 End=1482939><P>Don't do this.</P></SYNC>

The bishop may be able to help.</P></SYNC>

It'll only delay it.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1497245 End=1499498><P>You want
to do something?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1499581 End=1501333><P>You find out
who's trying to bury him.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1504294 End=1506338><P>Nobody's trying to bury him.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1506421 End=1508048><P>The evidence was there.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1508131 End=1509591><P>The evidence was cooked.</P></SYNC>

<SYNC Start=1528401 End=1529611><P>This is desperation, Michael.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1529694 End=1531738><P>You're grabbing at straws.
You're in denial.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1531821 End=1532656><P>Maybe.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1532739 End=1533990><P>But I can't watch him die.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1534783 End=1535742><P>I won't do that.</P></SYNC>

<SYNC Start=1567315 End=1570151><P>What is it about the Burrows situation
that I can help you with?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1570235 End=1573154><P>It's our understanding

<SYNC Start=1573238 End=1577742><P>I wouldn't say it's "great" or "influence."</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1577826 End=1579077><P>We're friends.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1579160 End=1582038><P>It's also our understanding

<SYNC Start=1582122 End=1583873><P>I'm a man of God.
How could I not?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1583957 End=1587168><P>In this case, we're hoping
you'll suspend that position.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1587252 End=1588878><P>At least temporarily.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1588962 End=1592966><P>If the inmate appeals
to me for intervention,</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1593049 End=1594509><P>how can I
turn my back on him?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1594593 End=1597554><P>You have a habit of answering
a question with a question.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1597637 End=1600932><P>And you have a way of asking questions
that beg more questions.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1605645 End=1607147><P>Are you saying
you won't do it?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1607230 End=1608898><P>I'm not a man to equivocate.</P></SYNC>

Your Excellency.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1615905 End=1616823><P>That's right.</P></SYNC>

tax system works.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1620368 End=1622037><P>Taking personal
capital gains</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1622120 End=1624247><P>under the church's
tax shelter...</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1624331 End=1626374><P>that would be fraud,
wouldn't it, Your Excellency?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1627626 End=1631463><P>I will not be cowed

<SYNC Start=1632130 End=1633923><P>Not by you or anyone else.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1635175 End=1636468><P>Admirable.</P></SYNC>

that the Secret Service is so interested in?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1646728 End=1648813><P>The man killed
the Vice President's brother.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1657072 End=1657947><P>What'd you say?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1658031 End=1659032><P>You heard me.</P></SYNC>

<SYNC Start=1679094 End=1680387><P>Like origami?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1680470 End=1681596><P>Yeah, like that.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1682305 End=1683598><P>Like origami.</P></SYNC>

<SYNC Start=1773772 End=1775523><P>Sort of wish it was true.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1775607 End=1776941><P>The man's a legend.</P></SYNC>

<SYNC Start=1793208 End=1794751><P>What is this all about?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1795835 End=1797837><P>Say you were able

<SYNC Start=1798755 End=1799839><P>would you have
the people in place</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1799923 End=1801966><P>to make sure
you disappeared forever?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1802050 End=1803009><P>What do you care?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1803468 End=1804969><P>Just curious.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1805053 End=1806638><P>Where's Fibonacci?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1806721 End=1808223><P>That's not the way

<SYNC Start=1812936 End=1815897><P>They come at me, John,
I'm coming after you.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1817106 End=1818107><P>I doubt it.</P></SYNC>

<SYNC Start=1868700 End=1869576><P>That's right.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1877792 End=1879294><P>Something you want to say?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1880003 End=1882046><P>It's just...</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1882130 End=1883756><P>I'm not of much value
to you in the SHU.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1884424 End=1885258><P>Value?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1885341 End=1887385><P>Hmm... The Taj.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1887468 End=1889470><P>It'd be a shame

<SYNC Start=1895727 End=1897270><P>The joints are overloaded.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1897353 End=1899647><P>They won't provide anywhere

<SYNC Start=1905028 End=1906362><P>You want it by when, June?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1906446 End=1907488><P>Yes.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1907572 End=1910158><P>Then we'd better get started,

<SYNC Start=1937393 End=1938436><P>Who's there?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=1956871 End=1958831><P>Bishop McMorrow

<SYNC Start=2020977 End=2022186><P>For what?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=2022270 End=2023688><P>Possession of marijuana.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=2026816 End=2030111><P>I figured he could use

-I didn't mean that.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=2033698 End=2035033><P>I know you didn't.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=2035116 End=2036200><P>Thanks, Lisa.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=2037952 End=2039120><P>Sit down.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=2044292 End=2045126><P>Dope, huh?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=2045793 End=2047003><P>Using or dealing?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=2048629 End=2049881><P>What's the difference?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=2049964 End=2053301><P>Then what, you, uh, think it gives you
some kind of street cred?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=2055303 End=2056554><P>You got a piece

<SYNC Start=2056637 End=2057638><P>Take advantage.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=2058973 End=2060475><P>Look, I get it.</P></SYNC>

<SYNC Start=2062226 End=2064145><P>She drags me in here,</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=2064228 End=2065605><P>you give me a big speech,</P></SYNC>

<SYNC Start=2067774 End=2069025><P>Straight A's.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=2069108 End=2071944><P>Harvard.
Grow up and be a dentist.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=2072028 End=2073279><P>It's better than being here.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=2075865 End=2077075><P>You got to realize

the things you're doing.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=2078993 End=2080745><P>You think it's me.
It's you.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=2080828 End=2082205><P>I did the same thing.</P></SYNC>

<SYNC Start=2089003 End=2091380><P>I'm not asking you

<SYNC Start=2091464 End=2094383><P>I already screwed up

to be friends.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=2268432 End=2270393><P>Casanova, wrap it up.</P></SYNC>

<SYNC Start=2331370 End=2332288><P>Why not?</P></SYNC>

<SYNC Start=2338919 End=2340296><P>Can you get it for me,

<SYNC Start=2343299 End=2344508><P>to keep going
back up to medical</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=2344592 End=2346510><P>to get an insulin shot
