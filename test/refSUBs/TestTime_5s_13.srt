1
00:00:05,104 --> 00:00:08,066
The Empire is gone, Mando.

2
00:00:09,817 --> 00:00:12,654
This asset
was of extreme importance to me.

3
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,990
<i>I had to ensure its delivery.</i>

4
00:00:16,115 --> 00:00:17,909
He's not a local warlord.

5
00:00:17,992 --> 00:00:19,035
He's Imperial.

6
00:00:19,702 --> 00:00:20,703
I'm in.

7
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:25,041
<i>Our secrecy is our survival.
Our survival is our strength.</i>

8
00:00:26,543 --> 00:00:28,461
<i>Our strength was once in our numbers.</i>

9
00:00:28,545 --> 00:00:30,046
Now, we live in the shadows.

10
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,508
Our world was shattered by the Empire.

11
00:00:38,263 --> 00:00:40,598
You're going
to have to relocate the covert.

12
00:00:40,682 --> 00:00:41,891
This is the Way.

13
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:45,645
In the wake of your destruction,
it was left behind.

14
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:47,564
Is it still a hunter?

15
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:49,816
No. But it will protect.

16
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:52,235
You got a real thing for droids,
don't you?

17
00:00:52,777 --> 00:00:54,612
I got a real thing for that droid.

18
00:00:54,696 --> 00:00:56,155
Let me take the child to him...

19
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,782
Let's kill him and get out of here.

20
00:00:57,866 --> 00:01:00,535
- We both need the client to be eliminated.
- He's right.

21
00:01:00,618 --> 00:01:03,013
As long as the Imp lives,
he'll send hunters after the child.

22
00:01:03,037 --> 00:01:04,038
<i>It's a trap.</i>

23
00:01:04,122 --> 00:01:06,833
<i>- Have they brought the child?</i>
- Yes, they have.

24
00:01:10,587 --> 00:01:12,630
<i>You have something I want.</i>

25
00:01:12,964 --> 00:01:14,674
Kuiil? Are you there?

26
00:01:16,718 --> 00:01:17,844
In a few moments...

27
00:01:19,304 --> 00:01:20,889
<i>Kuiil! Are you there?</i>

28
00:01:21,806 --> 00:01:23,975
It will be mine.

29
00:02:28,665 --> 00:02:31,626
Speeder bikes have arrived
at the checkpoint with the asset.

30
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:33,920
Awaiting confirmation.

31
00:02:34,337 --> 00:02:35,338
Knock it off!

32
00:02:37,382 --> 00:02:40,009
Waiting for confirmation
to continue into town.

33
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:42,679
<i>That's a go to proceed,
but I advise you to double-check.</i>

34
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:46,808
<i>The Moff just touched down and already
took out a squad of local troopers.</i>

35
00:02:48,893 --> 00:02:50,186
Standing by.

36
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:55,650
Did he just say
that Gideon killed his own men?

37
00:02:55,733 --> 00:02:57,902
Oh, who knows?

38
00:02:57,986 --> 00:03:01,322
These guys like to lay down the law
when they first arrive into town.

39
00:03:01,406 --> 00:03:03,241
You know how it is.

40
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:06,870
I said, shut up. Yeesh.

41
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:08,913
What is that thing, anyway?

42
00:03:08,997 --> 00:03:09,998
Uh, I don't know.

43
00:03:10,081 --> 00:03:12,750
Maybe Moff wants to eat it.
I don't ask questions.

44
00:03:15,003 --> 00:03:16,004
Can I see it?

45
00:03:16,838 --> 00:03:18,840
Did you not just hear
that Moff Gideon killed

46
00:03:18,923 --> 00:03:20,842
a dozen of his own troopers
to make a point.

47
00:03:20,925 --> 00:03:22,927
- Okay.
- I get that point.

48
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:24,971
- Do you get the point?
- Yes.

49
00:03:25,054 --> 00:03:26,055
Okay.

50
00:03:52,582 --> 00:03:54,375
Should we offer
that thing some water?

51
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:55,835
You just wanna look at it.

52
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:57,295
So what?
You got to see it!

53
00:03:57,378 --> 00:03:58,379
Barely.

54
00:03:58,463 --> 00:04:01,507
I mean, I grabbed it up off the ground
and I stuffed it in the sack.

55
00:04:02,091 --> 00:04:03,593
It's more than I got to see it.

56
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:06,804
Look, I'm not taking it out of
this bag until I deliver it to the Moff.

57
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,724
- Fine.
- Okay. Stop asking.

58
00:04:14,646 --> 00:04:17,232
Let me check on this thing. This is crazy.

59
00:04:17,315 --> 00:04:18,358
Any update yet?

60
00:04:18,441 --> 00:04:21,194
<i>That's a negative.
Still waiting on confirmation.</i>

61
00:04:21,277 --> 00:04:23,088
<i>He just killed an officer
for interrupting him,</i>

62
00:04:23,112 --> 00:04:25,114
<i>- so this might take a while.</i>

63
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:26,824
Thank you.

64
00:04:26,908 --> 00:04:29,452
Standing by still. Unbelievable.

65
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:33,581
Hey, how long has it been
since that thing moved?

66
00:04:33,665 --> 00:04:36,042
I don't know,
like a minute or two. Don't worry.

67
00:04:36,834 --> 00:04:38,878
Uh, it's been
way longer than a minute.

68
00:04:38,962 --> 00:04:39,963
Oh, my God.

69
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:42,090
Shouldn't we check
and see if it's still alive?

70
00:04:42,173 --> 00:04:43,466
You hit it pretty hard.

71
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,842
You just wanna see it.

72
00:04:44,926 --> 00:04:46,636
We should check
and see if it's hurt.

73
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,763
The last thing that you want
is to give Gideon a bag

74
00:04:48,846 --> 00:04:50,807
and have him open it
and find whatever is dead...

75
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,559
Okay. Okay, look.
Here you go. See?

76
00:04:52,642 --> 00:04:55,478
Take a peek. Everything's fine.

77
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:56,563
What is that?

78
00:04:56,855 --> 00:04:58,606
I don't know.
It's a pet or something.

79
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,149
A pet? I thought you...

80
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,280
Serves you right.

81
00:05:06,322 --> 00:05:07,740
Stop that.

82
00:05:08,366 --> 00:05:09,701
Identify yourself!

83
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:11,244
I am IG-11.

84
00:05:11,327 --> 00:05:15,498
I am this child's nurse droid and require
that you remand him to me immediately.

85
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:16,916
A nurse droid?

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,794
I thought it was a hunter.
Aren't IGs usually hunters?

87
00:05:19,878 --> 00:05:22,213
Yeah, well,
evidently this one's a nurse.

88
00:05:23,381 --> 00:05:26,301
I'm sorry, nurse,
but you're gonna have to get out of here.

89
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,928
Are you refusing my request?

90
00:05:29,012 --> 00:05:30,305
No.

91
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,973
I'm telling you to get out of here.

92
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:39,564
Hey.

93
00:05:50,074 --> 00:05:51,367
That was unpleasant.

94
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:52,869
I'm sorry you had to see that.

95
00:06:21,606 --> 00:06:22,732
Is there another way out?

96
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:24,192
No, that's it.

97
00:06:26,027 --> 00:06:28,279
- What about the sewers?
- Sewers?

98
00:06:28,363 --> 00:06:30,740
The Mandalorians
have a covert down in the sewers.

99
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:33,076
If we can get down there,
they can help us escape.

100
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,577
Yeah, sewers are good.

101
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:36,329
Checking for access points.

102
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,376
What the hell are they waiting for?

103
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:55,682
Hold up.

104
00:07:02,981 --> 00:07:04,274
They're setting up an E-Web.

105
00:07:06,109 --> 00:07:07,110
It's over.

106
00:07:10,488 --> 00:07:11,906
I found the sewer vent.

107
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,491
Let's get the hell out of here.

108
00:07:35,179 --> 00:07:37,307
It's assembled!
How long until that thing's cleared?

109
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,184
- Blow it.
- I'm out of charges.

110
00:07:40,268 --> 00:07:41,269
Get out of the way!

111
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:55,366
Your astute panic suggests
that you understand your situation.

112
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:59,245
I would prefer to avoid
any further violence,

113
00:07:59,329 --> 00:08:02,415
and encourage a moment of consideration.

114
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:06,794
Members of my escort
have completed assembly

115
00:08:06,878 --> 00:08:09,714
of an E-Web heavy repeating blaster.

116
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,800
If you are unfamiliar with this weapon,

117
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:16,930
I am sure that Republican Shock Trooper
Carasynthia Dune of Alderaan

118
00:08:17,013 --> 00:08:22,352
will advise you that she has witnessed
many of her ranks vaporize mid-descent

119
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:26,022
facing the predecessor
of this particular model.

120
00:08:28,525 --> 00:08:33,530
Or perhaps the decommissioned
Mandalorian hunter, Din Djarin,

121
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:38,076
has heard the songs
of the Siege of Mandalore,

122
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,204
when gunships outfitted
with similar ordnance

123
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:47,377
laid waste to fields of Mandalorian
recruits in The Night of a Thousand Tears.

124
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:55,593
I advise disgraced Magistrate Greef Karga
to search the wisdom of his years

125
00:08:56,094 --> 00:09:01,474
and urge you to lay down your arms
and come outside.

126
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:05,019
The structure you are trapped in
will be razed in short order

127
00:09:05,103 --> 00:09:09,440
and your storied lives will come
to an unceremonious end.

128
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,153
What do you propose?

129
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,198
Reasonable negotiation.

130
00:09:19,117 --> 00:09:20,743
What assurance do you offer?

131
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:24,455
If you're asking
if you can trust me, you cannot.

132
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:28,501
Just as you betrayed
our business arrangement,

133
00:09:28,585 --> 00:09:32,589
I would gladly break any promise
and watch you die at my hand.

134
00:09:33,131 --> 00:09:37,260
The assurance I give is this:
I will act in my own self-interest,

135
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:41,514
which at this time involves
your cooperation and benefit.

136
00:09:45,226 --> 00:09:50,231
I will give you until nightfall, and then
I will have the E-Web cannon open fire.

137
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,532
I say we hear him out.

138
00:09:59,657 --> 00:10:01,409
The minute we open that door, we're dead.

139
00:10:01,492 --> 00:10:02,911
We're dead if we don't.

140
00:10:03,161 --> 00:10:04,954
At least out there, we've got a shot.

141
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:06,473
That's easy for you to say.

142
00:10:06,497 --> 00:10:08,124
I'm a Rebel Shock Trooper.

143
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,959
They'll upload me to a Mind Flayer.

144
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:12,837
Those aren't real.
That was just wartime propaganda.

145
00:10:12,921 --> 00:10:15,423
I don't care to find out.
I'm shooting my way out of here.

146
00:10:16,925 --> 00:10:18,676
What about you, Mando?

147
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,011
I know who he is.

148
00:10:22,597 --> 00:10:23,765
It's Moff Gideon.

149
00:10:23,848 --> 00:10:24,891
No.

150
00:10:24,974 --> 00:10:27,185
Moff Gideon was executed for war crimes.

151
00:10:27,268 --> 00:10:29,687
It's him.
He knew my name.

152
00:10:29,771 --> 00:10:31,147
So? What does that prove?

153
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:33,733
I haven't heard that name
spoken since I was a child.

154
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:35,276
On Mandalore?

155
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,362
I was not born on Mandalore.

156
00:10:37,445 --> 00:10:38,530
But you're a Mandalorian.

157
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:40,448
Mandalorian isn't a race.

158
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:43,576
It's a Creed.

159
00:14:05,987 --> 00:14:07,447
I was a foundling.

160
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,240
They raised me in the Fighting Corps.

161
00:14:09,657 --> 00:14:11,409
I was treated as one of their own.

162
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:14,370
When I came of age,
I was sworn to the Creed.

163
00:14:14,537 --> 00:14:17,957
The only record of my family name
was in the registers of Mandalore.

164
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:21,628
Moff Gideon was an ISB Officer
during the purge.

165
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:24,088
That's how I know it's him.

166
00:14:24,214 --> 00:14:25,965
That's how he knows who we all are.

167
00:14:26,049 --> 00:14:29,302
He says he needs us,
which means the child got away safely.

168
00:14:29,385 --> 00:14:31,471
I was worried when the Ugnaught
didn't respond,

169
00:14:31,554 --> 00:14:34,641
but if they'd captured the kid,
we'd already be dead.

170
00:14:35,099 --> 00:14:36,100
Hail them again.

171
00:14:39,896 --> 00:14:41,064
Come in, Kuiil.

172
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:43,024
Kuiil?

173
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:45,944
- Nothing.
- They might have jammed the link.

174
00:14:51,866 --> 00:14:53,660
Kuiil has been terminated.

175
00:14:54,953 --> 00:14:56,204
What did you do?

176
00:14:56,287 --> 00:14:58,206
<i>I am fulfilling my base function.</i>

177
00:14:58,289 --> 00:14:59,374
Which is?

178
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:01,167
To nurse and protect.

00:15:08,925 --> 00:15:09,926
What was that?

180
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:11,010
Look alive.

181
00:15:51,843 --> 00:15:52,844
Look!

182
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:20,413
Cover me.

183
00:18:42,263 --> 00:18:43,431
Burn them out.

184
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,146
Stay with me, buddy.
We're gonna get you out of here.

185
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,106
This is our only path out.
Can you clear it?

186
00:18:55,276 --> 00:18:56,528
Stay with me.

187
00:18:56,945 --> 00:19:00,156
If you go near this child,
I will no choice but to kill you.

188
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,326
I understand.
Can you do anything to move the grate?

189
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:04,577
Yes, of course.

190
00:19:07,789 --> 00:19:09,791
Oh, I love IG units.

191
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:12,335
I'm not gonna make it. Go.

192
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:16,172
Shut up. You just got your bell rung.
You'll be fine.

193
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:17,340
Leave me.

194
00:19:21,386 --> 00:19:25,348
- I'm gonna need to take this thing off.
- No. You leave me.

195
00:19:25,557 --> 00:19:27,976
You make sure the child is safe.

196
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:30,103
Here.

197
00:19:32,897 --> 00:19:36,067
When you get to the Mandalorian covert,
you show them that.

198
00:19:36,192 --> 00:19:39,487
You tell them it's from Din Djarin.

199
00:19:39,571 --> 00:19:43,241
You tell them the foundling was
in my protection, and they'll help you.

200
00:19:43,324 --> 00:19:45,076
We can make it.

201
00:19:53,585 --> 00:19:55,128
Come on! Let's go!

202
00:19:55,211 --> 00:19:57,411
I'm not gonna make it and you know it.

204
00:20:17,442 --> 00:20:20,278
I can hold them back long enough
for you to escape.

205
00:20:20,361 --> 00:20:22,197
Let me have a warrior's death.

206
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,990
I won't leave you.

207
00:20:24,908 --> 00:20:26,492
This is the Way.

208
00:21:24,676 --> 00:21:26,386
Come on! It's open, let's go!

209
00:21:28,096 --> 00:21:30,848
Go. Go.

210
00:21:31,224 --> 00:21:33,184
We have to move! Now!

211
00:21:35,478 --> 00:21:36,646
Go.

212
00:21:38,481 --> 00:21:40,275
Escape and protect this child.

213
00:21:40,358 --> 00:21:42,277
I will stay with the Mandalorian.

214
00:21:46,281 --> 00:21:47,532
Promise me you'll bring him.

215
00:21:47,615 --> 00:21:48,992
You have my word.

216
00:22:05,049 --> 00:22:06,551
Do it.

217
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:08,011
Do what?

218
00:22:08,469 --> 00:22:10,013
Just get it over with.

219
00:22:11,139 --> 00:22:13,975
I'd rather you kill me than some Imp.

220
00:22:14,225 --> 00:22:16,477
I told you.
I am no longer a hunter.

221
00:22:16,561 --> 00:22:18,229
I am a nurse droid.

222
00:22:19,063 --> 00:22:21,691
IGs are all hunters.

223
00:22:21,983 --> 00:22:24,986
Not this one. I was reprogrammed.

224
00:22:25,069 --> 00:22:27,906
I need to remove your helmet
if I am to save you.

225
00:22:31,618 --> 00:22:34,120
Try it and I'll kill you.

226
00:22:36,831 --> 00:22:39,459
It is forbidden.

227
00:22:39,626 --> 00:22:44,339
No living thing has seen me
without my helmet since I swore the Creed.

228
00:22:46,341 --> 00:22:47,967
I am not a living thing.

229
00:22:57,894 --> 00:23:01,940
This is a bacta spray.
It will heal you in a matter of hours.

230
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:05,818
You have suffered damage
to your central processing unit.

231
00:23:07,737 --> 00:23:09,239
You mean my brain?

232
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:12,867
That was a joke.
It is meant to put you at ease.

233
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:41,104
I got you.

234
00:23:57,161 --> 00:23:58,496
Do you know which way to go?

235
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,582
No. I don't know these tunnels.

236
00:24:00,665 --> 00:24:02,375
I've only entered from the bazaar.

237
00:24:06,129 --> 00:24:08,756
Well, if we get the smell
of sulfur and we follow it,

238
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,509
it'll lead us up to the plains
where the river flows.

239
00:24:11,593 --> 00:24:14,220
And the Imps will
catch us before we make it to the ship.

240
00:24:14,304 --> 00:24:17,265
We need the Mandalorians
to escort us to safety.

241
00:24:22,937 --> 00:24:25,690
Ugh, this place is a maze.

242
00:24:25,773 --> 00:24:26,774
Stop.

243
00:24:28,568 --> 00:24:29,777
I can stand.

244
00:24:29,861 --> 00:24:31,821
The bacta infusion is working.

245
00:24:31,905 --> 00:24:33,573
I'll try to find tracks.

246
00:24:35,491 --> 00:24:36,492
We're close.

247
00:24:39,704 --> 00:24:40,784
Turn here.

248
00:25:35,009 --> 00:25:36,511
We should go.

249
00:25:36,594 --> 00:25:40,682
You go. Take the ship.
I can't leave it this way.

250
00:25:40,765 --> 00:25:41,975
Did you know about this?

251
00:25:42,433 --> 00:25:44,435
Is this the work of your bounty hunters?

252
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:45,520
No.

253
00:25:45,603 --> 00:25:48,314
When you left the system
and took the prize, the fighting ended

254
00:25:48,398 --> 00:25:50,275
and the hunters just melted away.

255
00:25:50,358 --> 00:25:52,235
You know how it is.

256
00:25:52,318 --> 00:25:54,279
They're mercenaries. They're not zealots.

257
00:25:54,362 --> 00:25:56,948
Did you do this? Did you?

258
00:25:57,031 --> 00:25:59,117
- No!
- It was not his fault.

259
00:26:01,619 --> 00:26:03,329
We revealed ourselves.

260
00:26:04,372 --> 00:26:07,709
We knew what could happen
if we left the covert.

261
00:26:09,377 --> 00:26:12,255
The Imperials arrived shortly thereafter.

262
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,384
This is what resulted.

263
00:26:17,468 --> 00:26:19,178
Did any survive?

264
00:26:19,345 --> 00:26:23,057
I hope so.
Some may have escaped off-world.

265
00:26:26,477 --> 00:26:27,562
Come with us.

266
00:26:28,313 --> 00:26:29,731
No.

267
00:26:29,814 --> 00:26:34,068
I will not abandon this place
until I have salvaged what remains.

268
00:27:07,101 --> 00:27:11,064
Show me the one
whose safety deemed such destruction.

269
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:15,068
This is the one.

270
00:27:15,318 --> 00:27:18,488
This is the one that you hunted,
then saved?

271
00:27:18,571 --> 00:27:21,699
Yes. The one that saved me as well.

272
00:27:22,784 --> 00:27:25,203
- From the mudhorn?
- Yes.

273
00:27:26,329 --> 00:27:27,705
It looks helpless.

274
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:32,293
It's injured, but it is not helpless.

275
00:27:32,377 --> 00:27:34,587
Its species can move objects
with its mind.

276
00:27:35,088 --> 00:27:36,881
I know of such things.

277
00:27:38,633 --> 00:27:43,846
The songs of eons past tell of battles
between Mandalore The Great,

278
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:48,309
and an order of sorcerers called Jedi
that fought with such powers.

279
00:27:48,851 --> 00:27:50,019
It is an enemy?

280
00:27:50,478 --> 00:27:54,607
No. Its kind were enemies,
but this individual is not.

281
00:27:55,942 --> 00:27:57,151
What is it?

282
00:27:57,652 --> 00:27:59,654
It is a foundling.

283
00:28:01,364 --> 00:28:04,242
By Creed, it is in your care.

284
00:28:06,661 --> 00:28:08,454
You wish me to train this thing?

285
00:28:08,538 --> 00:28:10,707
It is too weak. It would die.

286
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:14,377
You have no choice.
You must reunite it with its own kind.

287
00:28:15,169 --> 00:28:16,170
Where?

288
00:28:16,254 --> 00:28:17,964
This, you must determine.

289
00:28:19,173 --> 00:28:20,967
You expect me to search the galaxy

290
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:22,194
for the home of this creature

291
00:28:22,218 --> 00:28:24,721
and deliver it to a race
of enemy sorcerers?

292
00:28:26,806 --> 00:28:27,891
This is the Way.

293
00:28:33,271 --> 00:28:34,272
Hey.

294
00:28:34,731 --> 00:28:37,483
These tunnels will be lousy with Imps
in a matter of minutes.

295
00:28:37,692 --> 00:28:39,986
We should at least discuss an escape plan.

296
00:28:40,528 --> 00:28:42,113
If you follow
the descending tunnel,

297
00:28:42,197 --> 00:28:44,199
it will lead you to the underground river.

298
00:28:44,282 --> 00:28:46,409
It flows downstream toward the lava flats.

299
00:28:47,952 --> 00:28:49,370
I think we should go.

300
00:28:49,454 --> 00:28:50,622
I'm staying.

301
00:28:50,788 --> 00:28:52,707
I need to help her and I need to heal.

302
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:53,875
You must go.

303
00:28:53,958 --> 00:28:56,586
A foundling is in your care.

304
00:28:56,669 --> 00:29:02,008
By Creed, until it is of age or reunited
with its own kind,

305
00:29:02,091 --> 00:29:03,801
you are as its father.

306
00:29:09,849 --> 00:29:11,142
This is the Way.

307
00:29:13,978 --> 00:29:15,522
You have earned your Signet.

308
00:29:30,787 --> 00:29:32,205
You are a clan of two.

309
00:29:36,042 --> 00:29:37,418
Thank you.

310
00:29:37,502 --> 00:29:39,128
I will wear this with honor.

311
00:29:49,264 --> 00:29:50,265
We should go.

312
00:29:50,348 --> 00:29:52,809
IG, please guard
the outer hallway.

313
00:29:52,892 --> 00:29:54,727
A scouting party draws near.

314
00:29:56,563 --> 00:29:59,274
Hang on.
I don't do the baby thing.

315
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:04,112
I have one more gift
for your journey.

316
00:30:04,821 --> 00:30:07,490
Have you trained in the Rising Phoenix?

317
00:30:07,574 --> 00:30:09,367
When I was a boy. Yes.

318
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:13,246
Then this will make you complete.

319
00:30:15,248 --> 00:30:16,374
Thank you.

320
00:30:16,457 --> 00:30:19,002
ARMORER When you have healed,
you will begin your drills.

321
00:30:19,085 --> 00:30:21,546
Until you know it,
it will not listen to your commands.

322
00:30:21,629 --> 00:30:22,922
I understand.

Restock your munitions.

IG, carry this for Din Djarin
until he is well enough to wear it.

Now, go.

331
00:30:54,996 --> 00:30:56,998
Down to the river and across the plains.

Hey, Mando.

335
00:31:34,827 --> 00:31:35,828
Where are they?

336
00:31:38,373 --> 00:31:39,791
I said, where are they?

337
00:32:10,697 --> 00:32:12,156
This is the lava river.

338
00:32:18,788 --> 00:32:20,415
The ferry droid is fried.

339
00:32:20,498 --> 00:32:23,710
Yeah, but if we push the boat out,
we can get it to float downstream.

340
00:32:23,793 --> 00:32:24,794
Come on.

341
00:32:24,878 --> 00:32:26,629
Looks old. Will it take the heat?

342
00:32:26,713 --> 00:32:28,298
You got a better idea?

343
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:29,799
Guess not.

Oh!

Good job.

Watch your feet. It's molten lava.

351
00:32:59,787 --> 00:33:01,039
No kidding.

352
00:33:20,058 --> 00:33:22,560
I don't suppose anybody here speaks droid?

353
00:33:23,353 --> 00:33:25,813
I believe he is asking
where we would like to go.

354
00:33:27,023 --> 00:33:30,235
Down river. To the lava flat.

355
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,348
That's it. We're free!

356
00:34:06,062 --> 00:34:07,188
No.

357
00:34:07,647 --> 00:34:08,773
No, we're not.

358
00:34:08,857 --> 00:34:12,110
Stormtroopers.
They're flanking the mouth of the tunnel.

359
00:34:12,235 --> 00:34:15,196
It looks like an entire platoon.
They must know we're coming.

360
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,656
Stop the boat.

361
00:34:17,073 --> 00:34:19,659
Hey, Droid, I said stop the boat.

362
00:34:21,578 --> 00:34:23,580
Hey! I'm talking to you.

363
00:34:23,663 --> 00:34:24,998
I said stop!

364
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:32,714
We're still moving.

365
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,757
Looks like we fight.

366
00:34:34,841 --> 00:34:37,135
- There are too many.
- Then what do you suggest?

367
00:34:37,218 --> 00:34:38,511
'Cause I can't surrender.

368
00:34:38,595 --> 00:34:41,264
They will not be satisfied
with anything less than the child.

369
00:34:41,347 --> 00:34:42,891
This is unacceptable.

370
00:34:42,974 --> 00:34:45,560
I will eliminate the enemy
and you will escape.

371
00:34:45,643 --> 00:34:47,812
You don't have
that kind of firepower, pal.

372
00:34:47,896 --> 00:34:49,480
You wouldn't even get to daylight.

373
00:34:49,564 --> 00:34:50,815
That is not my objective.

374
00:34:51,232 --> 00:34:53,985
We're getting close. Saddle up.

375
00:34:55,695 --> 00:34:58,948
I still have the security protocols
from my manufacturer.

376
00:34:59,032 --> 00:35:02,202
If my designs are compromised,
I must self-destruct.

377
00:35:02,285 --> 00:35:03,828
What're you talking about?

378
00:35:03,912 --> 00:35:06,414
I am not permitted to be captured.
I must be destroyed.

379
00:35:06,539 --> 00:35:08,833
Are we gonna keep talking,
or get out of here?

380
00:35:09,626 --> 00:35:11,377
I can no longer carry this for you.

381
00:35:13,713 --> 00:35:15,048
Nor can I watch over the child.

382
00:35:15,673 --> 00:35:18,051
Wait. You can't self-destruct.

383
00:35:18,134 --> 00:35:19,928
Your base command is to watch the child.

384
00:35:20,011 --> 00:35:22,347
That supersedes
your manufacturer's protocol, right?

385
00:35:23,389 --> 00:35:24,974
- Right?
- This is correct.

386
00:35:25,058 --> 00:35:27,685
Good. Now, grab a blaster
and help us shoot our way out.

387
00:35:27,769 --> 00:35:29,479
Victory through combat
is impossible.

388
00:35:29,562 --> 00:35:32,315
We will be captured.
The child will be lost.

389
00:35:32,398 --> 00:35:36,194
Sadly, there is no scenario where
the child is saved, in which I survive.

390
00:35:37,278 --> 00:35:39,072
Listen, you're not going anywhere.

391
00:35:39,155 --> 00:35:40,758
We need you. Let's just come up with a...

392
00:35:40,782 --> 00:35:43,326
Please tell me the child
will be safe in your care.

393
00:35:43,409 --> 00:35:46,246
If you do so,
I can default to my secondary command.

394
00:35:46,871 --> 00:35:48,373
But you'll be destroyed.

395
00:35:48,623 --> 00:35:52,210
And you will live,
and I will have served my purpose.

396
00:35:53,419 --> 00:35:55,380
No. We need you.

397
00:35:55,463 --> 00:35:58,341
There is nothing to be sad about.
I have never been alive.

398
00:35:58,758 --> 00:36:00,552
I'm not sad.

399
00:36:00,718 --> 00:36:04,556
Yes, you are. I'm a nurse droid.
I've analyzed your voice.

400
00:36:12,188 --> 00:36:13,189
IG?

401
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,943
What're you doing?

402
00:36:48,641 --> 00:36:52,061
Manufacturer's protocol dictates
I cannot be captured.

403
00:36:54,105 --> 00:36:55,440
I must be destroyed.

404
00:37:30,642 --> 00:37:31,768
Moff Gideon!

405
00:37:46,366 --> 00:37:48,326
- He missed!
- He won't next time.

406
00:37:48,409 --> 00:37:50,286
Our blasters are useless against him.

407
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:52,288
Let's make the baby do
the magic hand thing.

408
00:37:52,413 --> 00:37:54,499
Come on, baby! Do the magic hand thing.

409
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,713
- I'm out of ideas.
- I'm not.

410
00:38:00,797 --> 00:38:02,257
Here he comes!

411
00:39:22,212 --> 00:39:23,213
No!

412
00:39:45,151 --> 00:39:48,655
That was impressive, Mando.
Very impressive.

413
00:39:50,073 --> 00:39:52,367
It looks like your Guild rates
have just gone up.

414
00:39:53,409 --> 00:39:54,869
Any more stormtroopers?

415
00:39:54,953 --> 00:39:56,538
I think we cleaned up the town.

416
00:39:57,789 --> 00:39:59,832
I'm thinking of staying around
just to be sure.

417
00:40:02,585 --> 00:40:05,046
- You're staying here?
- Well, why not?

418
00:40:05,129 --> 00:40:07,465
Nevarro is a very fine planet.

419
00:40:07,549 --> 00:40:10,635
And now that the scum and villainy
have been washed away,

420
00:40:10,718 --> 00:40:12,428
it's very respectable again.

421
00:40:12,512 --> 00:40:14,305
As a bounty hunter hive?

422
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:18,560
Some of my favorite people
are bounty hunters.

423
00:40:18,643 --> 00:40:23,898
And perhaps, this specimen of soldier
might consider joining our ranks.

424
00:40:23,982 --> 00:40:27,485
Yeah. I've got some clerical
concerns regarding my chain code.

425
00:40:27,569 --> 00:40:29,654
And if you would agree
to become my enforcer,

426
00:40:29,737 --> 00:40:33,032
clerical concerns would be
the least of your worries.

427
00:40:33,116 --> 00:40:38,496
But you, my friend, you will be welcome
back into the Guild with open arms.

428
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,874
So, go off, enjoy yourself.

429
00:40:41,666 --> 00:40:45,753
And when you're ready to return,
you will have the pick of all quarries.

430
00:40:52,677 --> 00:40:55,263
I'm afraid I have
more pressing matters at hand.

431
00:41:01,769 --> 00:41:03,521
Take care of this little one.

432
00:41:06,316 --> 00:41:09,777
Or maybe, it'll take care of you.

433
00:42:08,586 --> 00:42:10,004
What do you got there?

434
00:42:23,768 --> 00:42:25,270
I didn't think I'd see this again.

435
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,986
Why don't you hang onto that?
