1
00:00:00,104 --> 00:00:03,066
The Empire is gone, Mando.

2
00:00:04,817 --> 00:00:07,654
This asset
was of extreme importance to me.

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,990
I had to ensure its delivery.

4
00:00:11,115 --> 00:00:12,909
He's not a local warlord.

5
00:00:12,992 --> 00:00:14,035
He's Imperial.

6
00:00:14,702 --> 00:00:15,703
I'm in.

7
00:00:15,787 --> 00:00:20,041
Our secrecy is our survival.
Our survival is our strength.

8
00:00:21,543 --> 00:00:23,461
Our strength was once in our numbers.

9
00:00:23,545 --> 00:00:25,046
Now, we live in the shadows.

10
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,508
Our world was shattered by the Empire.

11
00:00:33,263 --> 00:00:35,598
You're going
to have to relocate the covert.

12
00:00:35,682 --> 00:00:36,891
This is the Way.

13
00:00:36,975 --> 00:00:40,645
In the wake of your destruction,
it was left behind.

14
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,564
Is it still a hunter?

15
00:00:42,647 --> 00:00:44,816
No. But it will protect.

16
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:47,235
You got a real thing for droids,
don't you?

17
00:00:47,777 --> 00:00:49,612
I got a real thing for that droid.

18
00:00:49,696 --> 00:00:51,155
Let me take the child to him...

19
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:52,782
Let's kill him and get out of here.

20
00:00:52,866 --> 00:00:55,535
- We both need the client to be eliminated.
- He's right.

21
00:00:55,618 --> 00:00:58,013
As long as the Imp lives,
he'll send hunters after the child.

22
00:00:58,037 --> 00:00:59,038
It's a trap.

23
00:00:59,122 --> 00:01:01,833
- Have they brought the child?
- Yes, they have.

24
00:01:05,587 --> 00:01:07,630
You have something I want.

25
00:01:07,964 --> 00:01:09,674
Kuiil? Are you there?

26
00:01:11,718 --> 00:01:12,844
In a few moments...

27
00:01:14,304 --> 00:01:15,889
Kuiil! Are you there?

28
00:01:16,806 --> 00:01:18,975
It will be mine.

29
00:02:23,665 --> 00:02:26,626
Speeder bikes have arrived
at the checkpoint with the asset.

30
00:02:26,751 --> 00:02:28,920
Awaiting confirmation.

31
00:02:29,337 --> 00:02:30,338
Knock it off!

32
00:02:32,382 --> 00:02:35,009
Waiting for confirmation
to continue into town.

33
00:02:35,093 --> 00:02:37,679
That's a go to proceed,
but I advise you to double-check.

34
00:02:37,762 --> 00:02:41,808
The Moff just touched down and already
took out a squad of local troopers.

35
00:02:43,893 --> 00:02:45,186
Standing by.

36
00:02:47,605 --> 00:02:50,650
Did he just say
that Gideon killed his own men?

37
00:02:50,733 --> 00:02:52,902
Oh, who knows?

38
00:02:52,986 --> 00:02:56,322
These guys like to lay down the law
when they first arrive into town.

39
00:02:56,406 --> 00:02:58,241
You know how it is.

40
00:02:58,783 --> 00:03:01,870
I said, shut up. Yeesh.

41
00:03:02,453 --> 00:03:03,913
What is that thing, anyway?

42
00:03:03,997 --> 00:03:04,998
Uh, I don't know.

43
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:07,750
Maybe Moff wants to eat it.
I don't ask questions.

44
00:03:10,003 --> 00:03:11,004
Can I see it?

45
00:03:11,838 --> 00:03:13,840
Did you not just hear
that Moff Gideon killed

46
00:03:13,923 --> 00:03:15,842
a dozen of his own troopers
to make a point.

47
00:03:15,925 --> 00:03:17,927
- Okay.
- I get that point.

48
00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:19,971
- Do you get the point?
- Yes.

49
00:03:20,054 --> 00:03:21,055
Okay.

50
00:03:47,582 --> 00:03:49,375
Should we offer
that thing some water?

51
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:50,835
You just wanna look at it.

52
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,295
So what?
You got to see it!

53
00:03:52,378 --> 00:03:53,379
Barely.

54
00:03:53,463 --> 00:03:56,507
I mean, I grabbed it up off the ground
and I stuffed it in the sack.

55
00:03:57,091 --> 00:03:58,593
It's more than I got to see it.

56
00:03:58,676 --> 00:04:01,804
Look, I'm not taking it out of
this bag until I deliver it to the Moff.

57
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,724
- Fine.
- Okay. Stop asking.

58
00:04:09,646 --> 00:04:12,232
Let me check on this thing. This is crazy.

59
00:04:12,315 --> 00:04:13,358
Any update yet?

60
00:04:13,441 --> 00:04:16,194
That's a negative.
Still waiting on confirmation.

61
00:04:16,277 --> 00:04:18,088
He just killed an officer
for interrupting him,

62
00:04:18,112 --> 00:04:20,114
- so this might take a while.

63
00:04:20,198 --> 00:04:21,824
Thank you.

64
00:04:21,908 --> 00:04:24,452
Standing by still. Unbelievable.

65
00:04:26,037 --> 00:04:28,581
Hey, how long has it been
since that thing moved?

66
00:04:28,665 --> 00:04:31,042
I don't know,
like a minute or two. Don't worry.

67
00:04:31,834 --> 00:04:33,878
Uh, it's been
way longer than a minute.

68
00:04:33,962 --> 00:04:34,963
Oh, my God.

69
00:04:35,046 --> 00:04:37,090
Shouldn't we check
and see if it's still alive?

70
00:04:37,173 --> 00:04:38,466
You hit it pretty hard.

71
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,842
You just wanna see it.

72
00:04:39,926 --> 00:04:41,636
We should check
and see if it's hurt.

73
00:04:41,719 --> 00:04:43,763
The last thing that you want
is to give Gideon a bag

74
00:04:43,846 --> 00:04:45,807
and have him open it
and find whatever is dead...

75
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,559
Okay. Okay, look.
Here you go. See?

76
00:04:47,642 --> 00:04:50,478
Take a peek. Everything's fine.

77
00:04:50,562 --> 00:04:51,563
What is that?

78
00:04:51,855 --> 00:04:53,606
I don't know.
It's a pet or something.

79
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,149
A pet? I thought you...

80
00:04:58,403 --> 00:05:00,280
Serves you right.

81
00:05:01,322 --> 00:05:02,740
Stop that.

82
00:05:03,366 --> 00:05:04,701
Identify yourself!

83
00:05:04,909 --> 00:05:06,244
I am IG-11.

84
00:05:06,327 --> 00:05:10,498
I am this child's nurse droid and require
that you remand him to me immediately.

85
00:05:10,582 --> 00:05:11,916
A nurse droid?

86
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,794
I thought it was a hunter.
Aren't IGs usually hunters?

87
00:05:14,878 --> 00:05:17,213
Yeah, well,
evidently this one's a nurse.

88
00:05:18,381 --> 00:05:21,301
I'm sorry, nurse,
but you're gonna have to get out of here.

89
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,928
Are you refusing my request?

90
00:05:24,012 --> 00:05:25,305
No.

91
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,973
I'm telling you to get out of here.

92
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:34,564
Hey.

93
00:05:45,074 --> 00:05:46,367
That was unpleasant.

94
00:05:46,451 --> 00:05:47,869
I'm sorry you had to see that.

95
00:06:16,606 --> 00:06:17,732
Is there another way out?

96
00:06:17,815 --> 00:06:19,192
No, that's it.

97
00:06:21,027 --> 00:06:23,279
- What about the sewers?
- Sewers?

98
00:06:23,363 --> 00:06:25,740
The Mandalorians
have a covert down in the sewers.

99
00:06:25,823 --> 00:06:28,076
If we can get down there,
they can help us escape.

100
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:29,577
Yeah, sewers are good.

101
00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:31,329
Checking for access points.

102
00:06:34,499 --> 00:06:36,376
What the hell are they waiting for?

103
00:06:49,681 --> 00:06:50,682
Hold up.

104
00:06:57,981 --> 00:06:59,274
They're setting up an E-Web.

105
00:07:01,109 --> 00:07:02,110
It's over.

106
00:07:05,488 --> 00:07:06,906
I found the sewer vent.

107
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:08,491
Let's get the hell out of here.

108
00:07:30,179 --> 00:07:32,307
It's assembled!
How long until that thing's cleared?

109
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:35,184
- Blow it.
- I'm out of charges.

110
00:07:35,268 --> 00:07:36,269
Get out of the way!

111
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:50,366
Your astute panic suggests
that you understand your situation.

112
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:54,245
I would prefer to avoid
any further violence,

113
00:07:54,329 --> 00:07:57,415
and encourage a moment of consideration.

114
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:01,794
Members of my escort
have completed assembly

115
00:08:01,878 --> 00:08:04,714
of an E-Web heavy repeating blaster.

116
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,800
If you are unfamiliar with this weapon,

117
00:08:07,926 --> 00:08:11,930
I am sure that Republican Shock Trooper
Carasynthia Dune of Alderaan

118
00:08:12,013 --> 00:08:17,352
will advise you that she has witnessed
many of her ranks vaporize mid-descent

119
00:08:17,435 --> 00:08:21,022
facing the predecessor
of this particular model.

120
00:08:23,525 --> 00:08:28,530
Or perhaps the decommissioned
Mandalorian hunter, Din Djarin,

121
00:08:29,239 --> 00:08:33,076
has heard the songs
of the Siege of Mandalore,

122
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:36,204
when gunships outfitted
with similar ordnance

123
00:08:36,287 --> 00:08:42,377
laid waste to fields of Mandalorian
recruits in The Night of a Thousand Tears.

124
00:08:44,128 --> 00:08:50,593
I advise disgraced Magistrate Greef Karga
to search the wisdom of his years

125
00:08:51,094 --> 00:08:56,474
and urge you to lay down your arms
and come outside.

126
00:08:56,599 --> 00:09:00,019
The structure you are trapped in
will be razed in short order

127
00:09:00,103 --> 00:09:04,440
and your storied lives will come
to an unceremonious end.

128
00:09:07,652 --> 00:09:09,153
What do you propose?

129
00:09:10,321 --> 00:09:12,198
Reasonable negotiation.

130
00:09:14,117 --> 00:09:15,743
What assurance do you offer?

131
00:09:15,827 --> 00:09:19,455
If you're asking
if you can trust me, you cannot.

132
00:09:20,665 --> 00:09:23,501
Just as you betrayed
our business arrangement,

133
00:09:23,585 --> 00:09:27,589
I would gladly break any promise
and watch you die at my hand.

134
00:09:28,131 --> 00:09:32,260
The assurance I give is this:
I will act in my own self-interest,

135
00:09:32,343 --> 00:09:36,514
which at this time involves
your cooperation and benefit.

136
00:09:40,226 --> 00:09:45,231
I will give you until nightfall, and then
I will have the E-Web cannon open fire.

137
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:54,532
I say we hear him out.

138
00:09:54,657 --> 00:09:56,409
The minute we open that door, we're dead.

139
00:09:56,492 --> 00:09:57,911
We're dead if we don't.

140
00:09:58,161 --> 00:09:59,954
At least out there, we've got a shot.

141
00:10:00,038 --> 00:10:01,473
That's easy for you to say.

142
00:10:01,497 --> 00:10:03,124
I'm a Rebel Shock Trooper.

143
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:04,959
They'll upload me to a Mind Flayer.

144
00:10:05,043 --> 00:10:07,837
Those aren't real.
That was just wartime propaganda.

145
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:10,423
I don't care to find out.
I'm shooting my way out of here.

146
00:10:11,925 --> 00:10:13,676
What about you, Mando?

147
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,011
I know who he is.

148
00:10:17,597 --> 00:10:18,765
It's Moff Gideon.

149
00:10:18,848 --> 00:10:19,891
No.

150
00:10:19,974 --> 00:10:22,185
Moff Gideon was executed for war crimes.

151
00:10:22,268 --> 00:10:24,687
It's him.
He knew my name.

152
00:10:24,771 --> 00:10:26,147
So? What does that prove?

153
00:10:26,231 --> 00:10:28,733
I haven't heard that name
spoken since I was a child.

154
00:10:29,234 --> 00:10:30,276
On Mandalore?

155
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,362
I was not born on Mandalore.

156
00:10:32,445 --> 00:10:33,530
But you're a Mandalorian.

157
00:10:33,905 --> 00:10:35,448
Mandalorian isn't a race.

158
00:10:37,075 --> 00:10:38,576
It's a Creed.

159
00:14:00,987 --> 00:14:02,447
I was a foundling.

160
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:04,240
They raised me in the Fighting Corps.

161
00:14:04,657 --> 00:14:06,409
I was treated as one of their own.

162
00:14:06,618 --> 00:14:09,370
When I came of age,
I was sworn to the Creed.

163
00:14:09,537 --> 00:14:12,957
The only record of my family name
was in the registers of Mandalore.

164
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:16,628
Moff Gideon was an ISB Officer
during the purge.

165
00:14:17,462 --> 00:14:19,088
That's how I know it's him.

166
00:14:19,214 --> 00:14:20,965
That's how he knows who we all are.

167
00:14:21,049 --> 00:14:24,302
He says he needs us,
which means the child got away safely.

168
00:14:24,385 --> 00:14:26,471
I was worried when the Ugnaught
didn't respond,

169
00:14:26,554 --> 00:14:29,641
but if they'd captured the kid,
we'd already be dead.

170
00:14:30,099 --> 00:14:31,100
Hail them again.

171
00:14:34,896 --> 00:14:36,064
Come in, Kuiil.

172
00:14:36,981 --> 00:14:38,024
Kuiil?

173
00:14:38,816 --> 00:14:40,944
- Nothing.
- They might have jammed the link.

174
00:14:46,866 --> 00:14:48,660
Kuiil has been terminated.

175
00:14:49,953 --> 00:14:51,204
What did you do?

176
00:14:51,287 --> 00:14:53,206
I am fulfilling my base function.

177
00:14:53,289 --> 00:14:54,374
Which is?

178
00:14:54,499 --> 00:14:56,167
To nurse and protect.

00:15:03,925 --> 00:15:04,926
What was that?

180
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:06,010
Look alive.

181
00:15:46,843 --> 00:15:47,844
Look!

182
00:16:14,412 --> 00:16:15,413
Cover me.

183
00:18:37,263 --> 00:18:38,431
Burn them out.

184
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:45,146
Stay with me, buddy.
We're gonna get you out of here.

185
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,106
This is our only path out.
Can you clear it?

186
00:18:50,276 --> 00:18:51,528
Stay with me.

187
00:18:51,945 --> 00:18:55,156
If you go near this child,
I will no choice but to kill you.

188
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,326
I understand.
Can you do anything to move the grate?

189
00:18:58,409 --> 00:18:59,577
Yes, of course.

190
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:04,791
Oh, I love IG units.

191
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:07,335
I'm not gonna make it. Go.

192
00:19:07,418 --> 00:19:11,172
Shut up. You just got your bell rung.
You'll be fine.

193
00:19:11,256 --> 00:19:12,340
Leave me.

194
00:19:16,386 --> 00:19:20,348
- I'm gonna need to take this thing off.
- No. You leave me.

195
00:19:20,557 --> 00:19:22,976
You make sure the child is safe.

196
00:19:24,102 --> 00:19:25,103
Here.

197
00:19:27,897 --> 00:19:31,067
When you get to the Mandalorian covert,
you show them that.

198
00:19:31,192 --> 00:19:34,487
You tell them it's from Din Djarin.

199
00:19:34,571 --> 00:19:38,241
You tell them the foundling was
in my protection, and they'll help you.

200
00:19:38,324 --> 00:19:40,076
We can make it.

201
00:19:48,585 --> 00:19:50,128
Come on! Let's go!

202
00:19:50,211 --> 00:19:52,411
I'm not gonna make it and you know it.

204
00:20:12,442 --> 00:20:15,278
I can hold them back long enough
for you to escape.

205
00:20:15,361 --> 00:20:17,197
Let me have a warrior's death.

206
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,990
I won't leave you.

207
00:20:19,908 --> 00:20:21,492
This is the Way.

208
00:21:19,676 --> 00:21:21,386
Come on! It's open, let's go!

209
00:21:23,096 --> 00:21:25,848
Go. Go.

210
00:21:26,224 --> 00:21:28,184
We have to move! Now!

211
00:21:30,478 --> 00:21:31,646
Go.

212
00:21:33,481 --> 00:21:35,275
Escape and protect this child.

213
00:21:35,358 --> 00:21:37,277
I will stay with the Mandalorian.

214
00:21:41,281 --> 00:21:42,532
Promise me you'll bring him.

215
00:21:42,615 --> 00:21:43,992
You have my word.

216
00:22:00,049 --> 00:22:01,551
Do it.

217
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:03,011
Do what?

218
00:22:03,469 --> 00:22:05,013
Just get it over with.

219
00:22:06,139 --> 00:22:08,975
I'd rather you kill me than some Imp.

220
00:22:09,225 --> 00:22:11,477
I told you.
I am no longer a hunter.

221
00:22:11,561 --> 00:22:13,229
I am a nurse droid.

222
00:22:14,063 --> 00:22:16,691
IGs are all hunters.

223
00:22:16,983 --> 00:22:19,986
Not this one. I was reprogrammed.

224
00:22:20,069 --> 00:22:22,906
I need to remove your helmet
if I am to save you.

225
00:22:26,618 --> 00:22:29,120
Try it and I'll kill you.

226
00:22:31,831 --> 00:22:34,459
It is forbidden.

227
00:22:34,626 --> 00:22:39,339
No living thing has seen me
without my helmet since I swore the Creed.

228
00:22:41,341 --> 00:22:42,967
I am not a living thing.

229
00:22:52,894 --> 00:22:56,940
This is a bacta spray.
It will heal you in a matter of hours.

230
00:22:57,815 --> 00:23:00,818
You have suffered damage
to your central processing unit.

231
00:23:02,737 --> 00:23:04,239
You mean my brain?

232
00:23:04,822 --> 00:23:07,867
That was a joke.
It is meant to put you at ease.

233
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:36,104
I got you.

234
00:23:52,161 --> 00:23:53,496
Do you know which way to go?

235
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,582
No. I don't know these tunnels.

236
00:23:55,665 --> 00:23:57,375
I've only entered from the bazaar.

237
00:24:01,129 --> 00:24:03,756
Well, if we get the smell
of sulfur and we follow it,

238
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,509
it'll lead us up to the plains
where the river flows.

239
00:24:06,593 --> 00:24:09,220
And the Imps will
catch us before we make it to the ship.

240
00:24:09,304 --> 00:24:12,265
We need the Mandalorians
to escort us to safety.

241
00:24:17,937 --> 00:24:20,690
Ugh, this place is a maze.

242
00:24:20,773 --> 00:24:21,774
Stop.

243
00:24:23,568 --> 00:24:24,777
I can stand.

244
00:24:24,861 --> 00:24:26,821
The bacta infusion is working.

245
00:24:26,905 --> 00:24:28,573
I'll try to find tracks.

246
00:24:30,491 --> 00:24:31,492
We're close.

247
00:24:34,704 --> 00:24:35,784
Turn here.

248
00:25:30,009 --> 00:25:31,511
We should go.

249
00:25:31,594 --> 00:25:35,682
You go. Take the ship.
I can't leave it this way.

250
00:25:35,765 --> 00:25:36,975
Did you know about this?

251
00:25:37,433 --> 00:25:39,435
Is this the work of your bounty hunters?

252
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:40,520
No.

253
00:25:40,603 --> 00:25:43,314
When you left the system
and took the prize, the fighting ended

254
00:25:43,398 --> 00:25:45,275
and the hunters just melted away.

255
00:25:45,358 --> 00:25:47,235
You know how it is.

256
00:25:47,318 --> 00:25:49,279
They're mercenaries. They're not zealots.

257
00:25:49,362 --> 00:25:51,948
Did you do this? Did you?

258
00:25:52,031 --> 00:25:54,117
- No!
- It was not his fault.

259
00:25:56,619 --> 00:25:58,329
We revealed ourselves.

260
00:25:59,372 --> 00:26:02,709
We knew what could happen
if we left the covert.

261
00:26:04,377 --> 00:26:07,255
The Imperials arrived shortly thereafter.

262
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,384
This is what resulted.

263
00:26:12,468 --> 00:26:14,178
Did any survive?

264
00:26:14,345 --> 00:26:18,057
I hope so.
Some may have escaped off-world.

265
00:26:21,477 --> 00:26:22,562
Come with us.

266
00:26:23,313 --> 00:26:24,731
No.

267
00:26:24,814 --> 00:26:29,068
I will not abandon this place
until I have salvaged what remains.

268
00:27:02,101 --> 00:27:06,064
Show me the one
whose safety deemed such destruction.

269
00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:10,068
This is the one.

270
00:27:10,318 --> 00:27:13,488
This is the one that you hunted,
then saved?

271
00:27:13,571 --> 00:27:16,699
Yes. The one that saved me as well.

272
00:27:17,784 --> 00:27:20,203
- From the mudhorn?
- Yes.

273
00:27:21,329 --> 00:27:22,705
It looks helpless.

274
00:27:24,791 --> 00:27:27,293
It's injured, but it is not helpless.

275
00:27:27,377 --> 00:27:29,587
Its species can move objects
with its mind.

276
00:27:30,088 --> 00:27:31,881
I know of such things.

277
00:27:33,633 --> 00:27:38,846
The songs of eons past tell of battles
between Mandalore The Great,

278
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:43,309
and an order of sorcerers called Jedi
that fought with such powers.

279
00:27:43,851 --> 00:27:45,019
It is an enemy?

280
00:27:45,478 --> 00:27:49,607
No. Its kind were enemies,
but this individual is not.

281
00:27:50,942 --> 00:27:52,151
What is it?

282
00:27:52,652 --> 00:27:54,654
It is a foundling.

283
00:27:56,364 --> 00:27:59,242
By Creed, it is in your care.

284
00:28:01,661 --> 00:28:03,454
You wish me to train this thing?

285
00:28:03,538 --> 00:28:05,707
It is too weak. It would die.

286
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:09,377
You have no choice.
You must reunite it with its own kind.

287
00:28:10,169 --> 00:28:11,170
Where?

288
00:28:11,254 --> 00:28:12,964
This, you must determine.

289
00:28:14,173 --> 00:28:15,967
You expect me to search the galaxy

290
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:17,194
for the home of this creature

291
00:28:17,218 --> 00:28:19,721
and deliver it to a race
of enemy sorcerers?

292
00:28:21,806 --> 00:28:22,891
This is the Way.

293
00:28:28,271 --> 00:28:29,272
Hey.

294
00:28:29,731 --> 00:28:32,483
These tunnels will be lousy with Imps
in a matter of minutes.

295
00:28:32,692 --> 00:28:34,986
We should at least discuss an escape plan.

296
00:28:35,528 --> 00:28:37,113
If you follow
the descending tunnel,

297
00:28:37,197 --> 00:28:39,199
it will lead you to the underground river.

298
00:28:39,282 --> 00:28:41,409
It flows downstream toward the lava flats.

299
00:28:42,952 --> 00:28:44,370
I think we should go.

300
00:28:44,454 --> 00:28:45,622
I'm staying.

301
00:28:45,788 --> 00:28:47,707
I need to help her and I need to heal.

302
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:48,875
You must go.

303
00:28:48,958 --> 00:28:51,586
A foundling is in your care.

304
00:28:51,669 --> 00:28:57,008
By Creed, until it is of age or reunited
with its own kind,

305
00:28:57,091 --> 00:28:58,801
you are as its father.

306
00:29:04,849 --> 00:29:06,142
This is the Way.

307
00:29:08,978 --> 00:29:10,522
You have earned your Signet.

308
00:29:25,787 --> 00:29:27,205
You are a clan of two.

309
00:29:31,042 --> 00:29:32,418
Thank you.

310
00:29:32,502 --> 00:29:34,128
I will wear this with honor.

311
00:29:44,264 --> 00:29:45,265
We should go.

312
00:29:45,348 --> 00:29:47,809
IG, please guard
the outer hallway.

313
00:29:47,892 --> 00:29:49,727
A scouting party draws near.

314
00:29:51,563 --> 00:29:54,274
Hang on.
I don't do the baby thing.

315
00:29:56,901 --> 00:29:59,112
I have one more gift
for your journey.

316
00:29:59,821 --> 00:30:02,490
Have you trained in the Rising Phoenix?

317
00:30:02,574 --> 00:30:04,367
When I was a boy. Yes.

318
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:08,246
Then this will make you complete.

319
00:30:10,248 --> 00:30:11,374
Thank you.

320
00:30:11,457 --> 00:30:14,002
ARMORER When you have healed,
you will begin your drills.

321
00:30:14,085 --> 00:30:16,546
Until you know it,
it will not listen to your commands.

322
00:30:16,629 --> 00:30:17,922
I understand.

Restock your munitions.

IG, carry this for Din Djarin
until he is well enough to wear it.

Now, go.

331

Down to the river and across the plains.

Hey, Mando.

335
00:31:29,827 --> 00:31:30,828
Where are they?

336
00:31:33,373 --> 00:31:34,791
I said, where are they?

337
00:32:05,697 --> 00:32:07,156
This is the lava river.

338
00:32:13,788 --> 00:32:15,415
The ferry droid is fried.

339
00:32:15,498 --> 00:32:18,710
Yeah, but if we push the boat out,
we can get it to float downstream.

340
00:32:18,793 --> 00:32:19,794
Come on.

341
00:32:19,878 --> 00:32:21,629
Looks old. Will it take the heat?

342
00:32:21,713 --> 00:32:23,298
You got a better idea?

343
00:32:23,798 --> 00:32:24,799
Guess not.

Oh!

Good job.

Watch your feet. It's molten lava.

351
00:32:54,787 --> 00:32:56,039
No kidding.

352
00:33:15,058 --> 00:33:17,560
I don't suppose anybody here speaks droid?

353
00:33:18,353 --> 00:33:20,813
I believe he is asking
where we would like to go.

354
00:33:22,023 --> 00:33:25,235
Down river. To the lava flat.

355
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,348
That's it. We're free!

356
00:34:01,062 --> 00:34:02,188
No.

357
00:34:02,647 --> 00:34:03,773
No, we're not.

358
00:34:03,857 --> 00:34:07,110
Stormtroopers.
They're flanking the mouth of the tunnel.

359
00:34:07,235 --> 00:34:10,196
It looks like an entire platoon.
They must know we're coming.

360
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,656
Stop the boat.

361
00:34:12,073 --> 00:34:14,659
Hey, Droid, I said stop the boat.

362
00:34:16,578 --> 00:34:18,580
Hey! I'm talking to you.

363
00:34:18,663 --> 00:34:19,998
I said stop!

364
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:27,714
We're still moving.

365
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:29,757
Looks like we fight.

366
00:34:29,841 --> 00:34:32,135
- There are too many.
- Then what do you suggest?

367
00:34:32,218 --> 00:34:33,511
'Cause I can't surrender.

368
00:34:33,595 --> 00:34:36,264
They will not be satisfied
with anything less than the child.

369
00:34:36,347 --> 00:34:37,891
This is unacceptable.

370
00:34:37,974 --> 00:34:40,560
I will eliminate the enemy
and you will escape.

371
00:34:40,643 --> 00:34:42,812
You don't have
that kind of firepower, pal.

372
00:34:42,896 --> 00:34:44,480
You wouldn't even get to daylight.

373
00:34:44,564 --> 00:34:45,815
That is not my objective.

374
00:34:46,232 --> 00:34:48,985
We're getting close. Saddle up.

375
00:34:50,695 --> 00:34:53,948
I still have the security protocols
from my manufacturer.

376
00:34:54,032 --> 00:34:57,202
If my designs are compromised,
I must self-destruct.

377
00:34:57,285 --> 00:34:58,828
What're you talking about?

378
00:34:58,912 --> 00:35:01,414
I am not permitted to be captured.
I must be destroyed.

379
00:35:01,539 --> 00:35:03,833
Are we gonna keep talking,
or get out of here?

380
00:35:04,626 --> 00:35:06,377
I can no longer carry this for you.

381
00:35:08,713 --> 00:35:10,048
Nor can I watch over the child.

382
00:35:10,673 --> 00:35:13,051
Wait. You can't self-destruct.

383
00:35:13,134 --> 00:35:14,928
Your base command is to watch the child.

384
00:35:15,011 --> 00:35:17,347
That supersedes
your manufacturer's protocol, right?

385
00:35:18,389 --> 00:35:19,974
- Right?
- This is correct.

386
00:35:20,058 --> 00:35:22,685
Good. Now, grab a blaster
and help us shoot our way out.

387
00:35:22,769 --> 00:35:24,479
Victory through combat
is impossible.

388
00:35:24,562 --> 00:35:27,315
We will be captured.
The child will be lost.

389
00:35:27,398 --> 00:35:31,194
Sadly, there is no scenario where
the child is saved, in which I survive.

390
00:35:32,278 --> 00:35:34,072
Listen, you're not going anywhere.

391
00:35:34,155 --> 00:35:35,758
We need you. Let's just come up with a...

392
00:35:35,782 --> 00:35:38,326
Please tell me the child
will be safe in your care.

393
00:35:38,409 --> 00:35:41,246
If you do so,
I can default to my secondary command.

394
00:35:41,871 --> 00:35:43,373
But you'll be destroyed.

395
00:35:43,623 --> 00:35:47,210
And you will live,
and I will have served my purpose.

396
00:35:48,419 --> 00:35:50,380
No. We need you.

397
00:35:50,463 --> 00:35:53,341
There is nothing to be sad about.
I have never been alive.

398
00:35:53,758 --> 00:35:55,552
I'm not sad.

399
00:35:55,718 --> 00:35:59,556
Yes, you are. I'm a nurse droid.
I've analyzed your voice.

400
00:36:07,188 --> 00:36:08,189
IG?

401
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,943
What're you doing?

402
00:36:43,641 --> 00:36:47,061
Manufacturer's protocol dictates
I cannot be captured.

403
00:36:49,105 --> 00:36:50,440
I must be destroyed.

404
00:37:25,642 --> 00:37:26,768
Moff Gideon!

405
00:37:41,366 --> 00:37:43,326
- He missed!
- He won't next time.

406
00:37:43,409 --> 00:37:45,286
Our blasters are useless against him.

407
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:47,288
Let's make the baby do
the magic hand thing.

408
00:37:47,413 --> 00:37:49,499
Come on, baby! Do the magic hand thing.

409
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,713
- I'm out of ideas.
- I'm not.

410
00:37:55,797 --> 00:37:57,257
Here he comes!

411
00:39:17,212 --> 00:39:18,213
No!

412
00:39:40,151 --> 00:39:43,655
That was impressive, Mando.
Very impressive.

413
00:39:45,073 --> 00:39:47,367
It looks like your Guild rates
have just gone up.

414
00:39:48,409 --> 00:39:49,869
Any more stormtroopers?

415
00:39:49,953 --> 00:39:51,538
I think we cleaned up the town.

416
00:39:52,789 --> 00:39:54,832
I'm thinking of staying around
just to be sure.

417
00:39:57,585 --> 00:40:00,046
- You're staying here?
- Well, why not?

418
00:40:00,129 --> 00:40:02,465
Nevarro is a very fine planet.

419
00:40:02,549 --> 00:40:05,635
And now that the scum and villainy
have been washed away,

420
00:40:05,718 --> 00:40:07,428
it's very respectable again.

421
00:40:07,512 --> 00:40:09,305
As a bounty hunter hive?

422
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:13,560
Some of my favorite people
are bounty hunters.

423
00:40:13,643 --> 00:40:18,898
And perhaps, this specimen of soldier
might consider joining our ranks.

424
00:40:18,982 --> 00:40:22,485
Yeah. I've got some clerical
concerns regarding my chain code.

425
00:40:22,569 --> 00:40:24,654
And if you would agree
to become my enforcer,

426
00:40:24,737 --> 00:40:28,032
clerical concerns would be
the least of your worries.

427
00:40:28,116 --> 00:40:33,496
But you, my friend, you will be welcome
back into the Guild with open arms.

428
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,874
So, go off, enjoy yourself.

429
00:40:36,666 --> 00:40:40,753
And when you're ready to return,
you will have the pick of all quarries.

430
00:40:47,677 --> 00:40:50,263
I'm afraid I have
more pressing matters at hand.

431
00:40:56,769 --> 00:40:58,521
Take care of this little one.

432
00:41:01,316 --> 00:41:04,777
Or maybe, it'll take care of you.

433
00:42:03,586 --> 00:42:05,004
What do you got there?

434
00:42:18,768 --> 00:42:20,270
I didn't think I'd see this again.

435
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,986
Why don't you hang onto that?
