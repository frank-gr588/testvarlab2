0:00:00.104 --> 0:00:03.066
The Empire is gone, Mando.

0:00:04.817 --> 0:00:07.654
This asset
was of extreme importance to me.

0:00:08.530 --> 0:00:10.990
<i>I had to ensure its delivery.</i>

0:00:11.115 --> 0:00:12.909
He's not a local warlord.

0:00:12.992 --> 0:00:14.035
He's Imperial.

0:00:14.702 --> 0:00:15.703
I'm in.

0:00:15.787 --> 0:00:20.041
<i>Our secrecy is our survival.
Our survival is our strength.</i>

0:00:21.543 --> 0:00:23.461
<i>Our strength was once in our numbers.</i>

0:00:23.545 --> 0:00:25.046
Now, we live in the shadows.

0:00:26.130 --> 0:00:28.508
Our world was shattered by the Empire.

0:00:33.263 --> 0:00:35.598
You're going
to have to relocate the covert.

0:00:35.682 --> 0:00:36.891
This is the Way.

0:00:36.975 --> 0:00:40.645
In the wake of your destruction,
it was left behind.

0:00:40.770 --> 0:00:42.564
Is it still a hunter?

0:00:42.647 --> 0:00:44.816
No. But it will protect.

0:00:44.899 --> 0:00:47.235
You got a real thing for droids,
don't you?

0:00:47.777 --> 0:00:49.612
I got a real thing for that droid.

0:00:49.696 --> 0:00:51.155
Let me take the child to him...

0:00:51.239 --> 0:00:52.782
Let's kill him and get out of here.

0:00:52.866 --> 0:00:55.535
- We both need the client to be eliminated.
- He's right.

0:00:55.618 --> 0:00:58.013
As long as the Imp lives,
he'll send hunters after the child.

0:00:58.037 --> 0:00:59.038
<i>It's a trap.</i>

0:00:59.122 --> 0:01:01.833
<i>- Have they brought the child?</i>
- Yes, they have.

0:01:05.587 --> 0:01:07.630
<i>You have something I want.</i>

0:01:07.964 --> 0:01:09.674
Kuiil? Are you there?

0:01:11.718 --> 0:01:12.844
In a few moments...

0:01:14.304 --> 0:01:15.889
<i>Kuiil! Are you there?</i>

0:01:16.806 --> 0:01:18.975
It will be mine.

0:02:23.665 --> 0:02:26.626
Speeder bikes have arrived
at the checkpoint with the asset.

0:02:26.751 --> 0:02:28.920
Awaiting confirmation.

0:02:29.337 --> 0:02:30.338
Knock it off!

0:02:32.382 --> 0:02:35.009
Waiting for confirmation
to continue into town.

0:02:35.093 --> 0:02:37.679
<i>That's a go to proceed,
but I advise you to double-check.</i>

0:02:37.762 --> 0:02:41.808
<i>The Moff just touched down and already
took out a squad of local troopers.</i>

0:02:43.893 --> 0:02:45.186
Standing by.

0:02:47.605 --> 0:02:50.650
Did he just say
that Gideon killed his own men?

0:02:50.733 --> 0:02:52.902
Oh, who knows?

0:02:52.986 --> 0:02:56.322
These guys like to lay down the law
when they first arrive into town.

0:02:56.406 --> 0:02:58.241
You know how it is.

0:02:58.783 --> 0:03:01.870
I said, shut up. Yeesh.

0:03:02.453 --> 0:03:03.913
What is that thing, anyway?

0:03:03.997 --> 0:03:04.998
Uh, I don't know.

0:03:05.081 --> 0:03:07.750
Maybe Moff wants to eat it.
I don't ask questions.

0:03:10.003 --> 0:03:11.004
Can I see it?

0:03:11.838 --> 0:03:13.840
Did you not just hear
that Moff Gideon killed

0:03:13.923 --> 0:03:15.842
a dozen of his own troopers
to make a point.

0:03:15.925 --> 0:03:17.927
- Okay.
- I get that point.

0:03:18.469 --> 0:03:19.971
- Do you get the point?
- Yes.

0:03:20.054 --> 0:03:21.055
Okay.

0:03:47.582 --> 0:03:49.375
Should we offer
that thing some water?

0:03:49.459 --> 0:03:50.835
You just wanna look at it.

0:03:50.919 --> 0:03:52.295
So what?
You got to see it!

0:03:52.378 --> 0:03:53.379
Barely.

0:03:53.463 --> 0:03:56.507
I mean, I grabbed it up off the ground
and I stuffed it in the sack.

0:03:57.091 --> 0:03:58.593
It's more than I got to see it.

0:03:58.676 --> 0:04:01.804
Look, I'm not taking it out of
this bag until I deliver it to the Moff.

0:04:02.180 --> 0:04:04.724
- Fine.
- Okay. Stop asking.

0:04:09.646 --> 0:04:12.232
Let me check on this thing. This is crazy.

0:04:12.315 --> 0:04:13.358
Any update yet?

0:04:13.441 --> 0:04:16.194
<i>That's a negative.
Still waiting on confirmation.</i>

0:04:16.277 --> 0:04:18.088
<i>He just killed an officer
for interrupting him,</i>

0:04:18.112 --> 0:04:20.114
<i>- so this might take a while.</i>

0:04:20.198 --> 0:04:21.824
Thank you.

0:04:21.908 --> 0:04:24.452
Standing by still. Unbelievable.

0:04:26.037 --> 0:04:28.581
Hey, how long has it been
since that thing moved?

0:04:28.665 --> 0:04:31.042
I don't know,
like a minute or two. Don't worry.

0:04:31.834 --> 0:04:33.878
Uh, it's been
way longer than a minute.

0:04:33.962 --> 0:04:34.963
Oh, my God.

0:04:35.046 --> 0:04:37.090
Shouldn't we check
and see if it's still alive?

0:04:37.173 --> 0:04:38.466
You hit it pretty hard.

0:04:38.550 --> 0:04:39.842
You just wanna see it.

0:04:39.926 --> 0:04:41.636
We should check
and see if it's hurt.

0:04:41.719 --> 0:04:43.763
The last thing that you want
is to give Gideon a bag

0:04:43.846 --> 0:04:45.807
and have him open it
and find whatever is dead...

0:04:45.890 --> 0:04:47.559
Okay. Okay, look.
Here you go. See?

0:04:47.642 --> 0:04:50.478
Take a peek. Everything's fine.

0:04:50.562 --> 0:04:51.563
What is that?

0:04:51.855 --> 0:04:53.606
I don't know.
It's a pet or something.

0:04:53.690 --> 0:04:55.149
A pet? I thought you...

0:04:58.403 --> 0:05:00.280
Serves you right.

Stop that.

0:05:03.366 --> 0:05:04.701
Identify yourself!

0:05:04.909 --> 0:05:06.244
I am IG-11.

0:05:06.327 --> 0:05:10.498
I am this child's nurse droid and require
that you remand him to me immediately.

0:05:10.582 --> 0:05:11.916
A nurse droid?

0:05:12.000 --> 0:05:14.794
I thought it was a hunter.
Aren't IGs usually hunters?

0:05:14.878 --> 0:05:17.213
Yeah, well,
evidently this one's a nurse.

0:05:18.381 --> 0:05:21.301
I'm sorry, nurse,
but you're gonna have to get out of here.

0:05:22.260 --> 0:05:23.928
Are you refusing my request?

0:05:24.012 --> 0:05:25.305
No.

0:05:25.430 --> 0:05:26.973
I'm telling you to get out of here.

0:05:32.478 --> 0:05:34.564
Hey.

0:05:45.074 --> 0:05:46.367
That was unpleasant.

0:05:46.451 --> 0:05:47.869
I'm sorry you had to see that.

0:06:16.606 --> 0:06:17.732
Is there another way out?

0:06:17.815 --> 0:06:19.192
No, that's it.

0:06:21.027 --> 0:06:23.279
- What about the sewers?
- Sewers?

0:06:23.363 --> 0:06:25.740
The Mandalorians
have a covert down in the sewers.

0:06:25.823 --> 0:06:28.076
If we can get down there,
they can help us escape.

0:06:28.159 --> 0:06:29.577
Yeah, sewers are good.

0:06:29.661 --> 0:06:31.329
Checking for access points.

0:06:34.499 --> 0:06:36.376
What the hell are they waiting for?

0:06:49.681 --> 0:06:50.682
Hold up.

0:06:57.981 --> 0:06:59.274
They're setting up an E-Web.

0:07:01.109 --> 0:07:02.110
It's over.

0:07:05.488 --> 0:07:06.906
I found the sewer vent.

0:07:06.990 --> 0:07:08.491
Let's get the hell out of here.

0:07:30.179 --> 0:07:32.307
It's assembled!
How long until that thing's cleared?

0:07:32.390 --> 0:07:35.184
- Blow it.
- I'm out of charges.

0:07:35.268 --> 0:07:36.269
Get out of the way!

0:07:45.820 --> 0:07:50.366
Your astute panic suggests
that you understand your situation.

0:07:50.700 --> 0:07:54.245
I would prefer to avoid
any further violence,

0:07:54.329 --> 0:07:57.415
and encourage a moment of consideration.

0:07:58.166 --> 0:08:01.794
Members of my escort
have completed assembly

0:08:01.878 --> 0:08:04.714
of an E-Web heavy repeating blaster.

0:08:06.090 --> 0:08:07.800
If you are unfamiliar with this weapon,

0:08:07.926 --> 0:08:11.930
I am sure that Republican Shock Trooper
Carasynthia Dune of Alderaan

0:08:12.013 --> 0:08:17.352
will advise you that she has witnessed
many of her ranks vaporize mid-descent

0:08:17.435 --> 0:08:21.022
facing the predecessor
of this particular model.

0:08:23.525 --> 0:08:28.530
Or perhaps the decommissioned
Mandalorian hunter, Din Djarin,

0:08:29.239 --> 0:08:33.076
has heard the songs
of the Siege of Mandalore,

0:08:33.159 --> 0:08:36.204
when gunships outfitted
with similar ordnance

0:08:36.287 --> 0:08:42.377
laid waste to fields of Mandalorian
recruits in The Night of a Thousand Tears.

0:08:44.128 --> 0:08:50.593
I advise disgraced Magistrate Greef Karga
to search the wisdom of his years

0:08:51.094 --> 0:08:56.474
and urge you to lay down your arms
and come outside.

0:08:56.599 --> 0:09:00.019
The structure you are trapped in
will be razed in short order

0:09:00.103 --> 0:09:04.440
and your storied lives will come
to an unceremonious end.

0:09:07.652 --> 0:09:09.153
What do you propose?

0:09:10.321 --> 0:09:12.198
Reasonable negotiation.

0:09:14.117 --> 0:09:15.743
What assurance do you offer?

0:09:15.827 --> 0:09:19.455
If you're asking
if you can trust me, you cannot.

0:09:20.665 --> 0:09:23.501
Just as you betrayed
our business arrangement,

0:09:23.585 --> 0:09:27.589
I would gladly break any promise
and watch you die at my hand.

0:09:28.131 --> 0:09:32.260
The assurance I give is this:
I will act in my own self-interest,

0:09:32.343 --> 0:09:36.514
which at this time involves
your cooperation and benefit.

0:09:40.226 --> 0:09:45.231
I will give you until nightfall, and then
I will have the E-Web cannon open fire.

0:09:52.530 --> 0:09:54.532
I say we hear him out.

0:09:54.657 --> 0:09:56.409
The minute we open that door, we're dead.

0:09:56.492 --> 0:09:57.911
We're dead if we don't.

0:09:58.161 --> 0:09:59.954
At least out there, we've got a shot.

0:10:00.038 --> 0:10:01.473
That's easy for you to say.

They'll upload me to a Mind Flayer.

0:10:05.043 --> 0:10:07.837
Those aren't real.
That was just wartime propaganda.

0:10:07.921 --> 0:10:10.423
I don't care to find out.
I'm shooting my way out of here.

0:10:11.925 --> 0:10:13.676
What about you, Mando?

0:10:13.760 --> 0:10:15.011
I know who he is.

0:10:17.597 --> 0:10:18.765
It's Moff Gideon.

0:10:18.848 --> 0:10:19.891
No.

0:10:19.974 --> 0:10:22.185
Moff Gideon was executed for war crimes.

0:10:22.268 --> 0:10:24.687
It's him.
He knew my name.

0:10:24.771 --> 0:10:26.147
So? What does that prove?

0:10:26.231 --> 0:10:28.733
I haven't heard that name
spoken since I was a child.

0:10:29.234 --> 0:10:30.276
On Mandalore?

0:10:30.360 --> 0:10:32.362
I was not born on Mandalore.

0:10:32.445 --> 0:10:33.530
But you're a Mandalorian.

0:10:33.905 --> 0:10:35.448
Mandalorian isn't a race.

0:10:37.075 --> 0:10:38.576
It's a Creed.

0:14:00.987 --> 0:14:02.447
I was a foundling.

0:14:02.530 --> 0:14:04.240
They raised me in the Fighting Corps.

0:14:04.657 --> 0:14:06.409
I was treated as one of their own.

0:14:06.618 --> 0:14:09.370
When I came of age,
I was sworn to the Creed.

0:14:09.537 --> 0:14:12.957
The only record of my family name
was in the registers of Mandalore.

0:14:13.041 --> 0:14:16.628
Moff Gideon was an ISB Officer
during the purge.

0:14:17.462 --> 0:14:19.088
That's how I know it's him.

0:14:19.214 --> 0:14:20.965
That's how he knows who we all are.

0:14:21.049 --> 0:14:24.302
He says he needs us,
which means the child got away safely.

0:14:24.385 --> 0:14:26.471
I was worried when the Ugnaught
didn't respond,

0:14:26.554 --> 0:14:29.641
but if they'd captured the kid,
we'd already be dead.

0:14:30.099 --> 0:14:31.100
Hail them again.

0:14:34.896 --> 0:14:36.064

Kuiil?

0:14:38.816 --> 0:14:40.944
- Nothing.
- They might have jammed the link.

0:14:46.866 --> 0:14:48.660
Kuiil has been terminated.

0:14:49.953 --> 0:14:51.204

You tell them it's from Din Djarin.

You tell them the foundling was

0:21:23.096 --> 0:21:25.848
Go. Go.

0:21:26.224 --> 0:21:28.184
We have to move! Now!

0:21:30.478 --> 0:21:31.646
Go.

0:21:33.481 --> 0:21:35.275
Escape and protect this child.

0:21:35.358 --> 0:21:37.277
I will stay with the Mandalorian.

0:21:41.281 --> 0:21:42.532
Promise me you'll bring him.

0:21:42.615 --> 0:21:43.992
You have my word.

0:22:00.049 --> 0:22:01.551
Do it.

0:22:02.010 --> 0:22:03.011
Do what?

0:22:03.469 --> 0:22:05.013
Just get it over with.

0:22:06.139 --> 0:22:08.975
I'd rather you kill me than some Imp.

0:22:09.225 --> 0:22:11.477
I told you.
I am no longer a hunter.

0:22:11.561 --> 0:22:13.229
I am a nurse droid.

0:22:14.063 --> 0:22:16.691
IGs are all hunters.

0:22:16.983 --> 0:22:19.986
Not this one. I was reprogrammed.

0:22:20.069 --> 0:22:22.906
I need to remove your helmet
if I am to save you.

0:22:26.618 --> 0:22:29.120
Try it and I'll kill you.

0:22:31.831 --> 0:22:34.459
It is forbidden.

0:22:34.626 --> 0:22:39.339
No living thing has seen me
without my helmet since I swore the Creed.

0:22:41.341 --> 0:22:42.967
I am not a living thing.

0:22:52.894 --> 0:22:56.940
This is a bacta spray.
It will heal you in a matter of hours.

0:22:57.815 --> 0:23:00.818
You have suffered damage
to your central processing unit.

0:23:02.737 --> 0:23:04.239
You mean my brain?

0:23:04.822 --> 0:23:07.867
That was a joke.
It is meant to put you at ease.

0:23:34.519 --> 0:23:36.104
I got you.

0:23:52.161 --> 0:23:53.496
Do you know which way to go?

0:23:53.580 --> 0:23:55.582
No. I don't know these tunnels.

0:23:55.665 --> 0:23:57.375
I've only entered from the bazaar.

0:24:01.129 --> 0:24:03.756
Well, if we get the smell
of sulfur and we follow it,

0:24:03.840 --> 0:24:06.509
it'll lead us up to the plains
where the river flows.

0:24:06.593 --> 0:24:09.220
And the Imps will
catch us before we make it to the ship.

0:24:09.304 --> 0:24:12.265
We need the Mandalorians
to escort us to safety.

0:24:17.937 --> 0:24:20.690
Ugh, this place is a maze.

0:24:20.773 --> 0:24:21.774
Stop.

0:24:23.568 --> 0:24:24.777
I can stand.

0:24:24.861 --> 0:24:26.821
The bacta infusion is working.

0:24:26.905 --> 0:24:28.573
I'll try to find tracks.

0:24:30.491 --> 0:24:31.492
We're close.

0:24:34.704 --> 0:24:35.784
Turn here.

0:25:30.009 --> 0:25:31.511
We should go.

0:25:31.594 --> 0:25:35.682
You go. Take the ship.
I can't leave it this way.

0:25:35.765 --> 0:25:36.975
Did you know about this?

0:25:37.433 --> 0:25:39.435
Is this the work of your bounty hunters?

0:25:39.519 --> 0:25:40.520
No.

0:25:40.603 --> 0:25:43.314
When you left the system
and took the prize, the fighting ended

0:25:43.398 --> 0:25:45.275
and the hunters just melted away.

0:25:45.358 --> 0:25:47.235
You know how it is.

0:25:47.318 --> 0:25:49.279
They're mercenaries. They're not zealots.

0:25:49.362 --> 0:25:51.948
Did you do this? Did you?

0:25:52.031 --> 0:25:54.117
- No!
- It was not his fault.

0:25:56.619 --> 0:25:58.329
We revealed ourselves.

0:25:59.372 --> 0:26:02.709
We knew what could happen
if we left the covert.

0:26:04.377 --> 0:26:07.255
The Imperials arrived shortly thereafter.

0:26:08.840 --> 0:26:11.384
This is what resulted.

0:26:12.468 --> 0:26:14.178
Did any survive?

0:26:14.345 --> 0:26:18.057
I hope so.
Some may have escaped off-world.

0:26:21.477 --> 0:26:22.562
Come with us.

0:26:23.313 --> 0:26:24.731
No.

0:26:24.814 --> 0:26:29.068
I will not abandon this place
until I have salvaged what remains.

0:27:02.101 --> 0:27:06.064
Show me the one
whose safety deemed such destruction.

0:27:08.399 --> 0:27:10.068
This is the one.

0:27:10.318 --> 0:27:13.488
This is the one that you hunted,
then saved?

0:27:13.571 --> 0:27:16.699
Yes. The one that saved me as well.

0:27:17.784 --> 0:27:20.203
- From the mudhorn?
- Yes.

0:27:21.329 --> 0:27:22.705
It looks helpless.

0:27:24.791 --> 0:27:27.293
It's injured, but it is not helpless.

0:27:27.377 --> 0:27:29.587
Its species can move objects
with its mind.

0:27:30.088 --> 0:27:31.881
I know of such things.

0:27:33.633 --> 0:27:38.846
The songs of eons past tell of battles
between Mandalore The Great,

0:27:38.930 --> 0:27:43.309
and an order of sorcerers called Jedi
that fought with such powers.

0:27:43.851 --> 0:27:45.019
It is an enemy?

0:27:45.478 --> 0:27:49.607
No. Its kind were enemies,
but this individual is not.

0:27:50.942 --> 0:27:52.151
What is it?

0:27:52.652 --> 0:27:54.654
It is a foundling.

0:27:56.364 --> 0:27:59.242
By Creed, it is in your care.

0:28:01.661 --> 0:28:03.454
You wish me to train this thing?

0:28:03.538 --> 0:28:05.707
It is too weak. It would die.

0:28:05.790 --> 0:28:09.377
You have no choice.
You must reunite it with its own kind.

0:28:10.169 --> 0:28:11.170
Where?

0:28:11.254 --> 0:28:12.964
This, you must determine.

0:28:14.173 --> 0:28:15.967
You expect me to search the galaxy

0:28:16.050 --> 0:28:17.194
for the home of this creature

0:28:17.218 --> 0:28:19.721
and deliver it to a race
of enemy sorcerers?

0:28:21.806 --> 0:28:22.891
This is the Way.

0:28:28.271 --> 0:28:29.272
Hey.

0:28:29.731 --> 0:28:32.483
These tunnels will be lousy with Imps
in a matter of minutes.

0:28:32.692 --> 0:28:34.986
We should at least discuss an escape plan.

0:28:35.528 --> 0:28:37.113
If you follow
the descending tunnel,

0:28:37.197 --> 0:28:39.199
it will lead you to the underground river.

0:28:39.282 --> 0:28:41.409
It flows downstream toward the lava flats.

0:28:42.952 --> 0:28:44.370
I think we should go.

0:28:44.454 --> 0:28:45.622
I'm staying.

0:28:45.788 --> 0:28:47.707
I need to help her and I need to heal.

0:28:47.790 --> 0:28:48.875
You must go.

0:28:48.958 --> 0:28:51.586
A foundling is in your care.

0:28:51.669 --> 0:28:57.008
By Creed, until it is of age or reunited
with its own kind,

0:28:57.091 --> 0:28:58.801
you are as its father.

0:29:04.849 --> 0:29:06.142
This is the Way.

0:29:08.978 --> 0:29:10.522
You have earned your Signet.

0:29:25.787 --> 0:29:27.205
You are a clan of two.

0:29:31.042 --> 0:29:32.418
Thank you.

0:29:32.502 --> 0:29:34.128
I will wear this with honor.

0:29:44.264 --> 0:29:45.265
We should go.

0:29:45.348 --> 0:29:47.809
IG, please guard
the outer hallway.

0:29:47.892 --> 0:29:49.727
A scouting party draws near.

0:29:51.563 --> 0:29:54.274
Hang on.
I don't do the baby thing.

0:29:56.901 --> 0:29:59.112
I have one more gift
for your journey.

0:29:59.821 --> 0:30:02.490
Have you trained in the Rising Phoenix?

0:30:02.574 --> 0:30:04.367
When I was a boy. Yes.

0:30:04.450 --> 0:30:08.246
Then this will make you complete.

0:30:10.248 --> 0:30:11.374
Thank you.

0:30:11.457 --> 0:30:14.002
ARMORER When you have healed,
you will begin your drills.

0:30:14.085 --> 0:30:16.546
Until you know it,
it will not listen to your commands.

0:30:16.629 --> 0:30:17.922
I understand.

Restock your munitions.

until he is well enough to wear it.

0:30:48.703 --> 0:30:49.913
Now, go.

0:30:49.996 --> 0:30:51.998
Down to the river and across the plains.

0:30:54.209 --> 0:30:55.501
Be safe on your journey.

0:30:55.585 --> 0:30:56.586

Hey, Mando.

0:31:29.827 --> 0:31:30.828
Where are they?

0:31:33.373 --> 0:31:34.791
I said, where are they?

0:32:05.697 --> 0:32:07.156
This is the lava river.

0:32:13.788 --> 0:32:15.415
The ferry droid is fried.

0:32:15.498 --> 0:32:18.710
Yeah, but if we push the boat out,
we can get it to float downstream.

0:32:18.793 --> 0:32:19.794
Come on.

0:32:19.878 --> 0:32:21.629
Looks old. Will it take the heat?

0:32:21.713 --> 0:32:23.298
You got a better idea?

0:32:23.798 --> 0:32:24.799
Guess not.

0:32:28.845 --> 0:32:29.846
Push!

0:32:32.181 --> 0:32:33.558
Come on! What're you doing?

0:32:33.641 --> 0:32:35.768
- Let's try this.
- Push!

0:32:39.272 --> 0:32:41.065
You guys mind getting out of the way?

0:32:41.357 --> 0:32:42.358
Oh!

0:32:47.864 --> 0:32:48.865
Good job.

0:32:51.910 --> 0:32:54.704
Watch your feet. It's molten lava.

0:32:54.787 --> 0:32:56.039
No kidding.

0:33:15.058 --> 0:33:17.560
I don't suppose anybody here speaks droid?

0:33:18.353 --> 0:33:20.813
I believe he is asking
where we would like to go.

0:33:22.023 --> 0:33:25.235
Down river. To the lava flat.

0:33:53.680 --> 0:33:55.348
That's it. We're free!

0:34:01.062 --> 0:34:02.188
No.

0:34:02.647 --> 0:34:03.773
No, we're not.

0:34:03.857 --> 0:34:07.110
Stormtroopers.
They're flanking the mouth of the tunnel.

0:34:07.235 --> 0:34:10.196
It looks like an entire platoon.
They must know we're coming.

0:34:10.280 --> 0:34:11.656
Stop the boat.

0:34:12.073 --> 0:34:14.659
Hey, Droid, I said stop the boat.

0:34:16.578 --> 0:34:18.580
Hey! I'm talking to you.

0:34:18.663 --> 0:34:19.998
I said stop!

0:34:26.170 --> 0:34:27.714
We're still moving.

0:34:28.590 --> 0:34:29.757
Looks like we fight.

0:34:29.841 --> 0:34:32.135
- There are too many.
- Then what do you suggest?

0:34:32.218 --> 0:34:33.511
'Cause I can't surrender.

0:34:33.595 --> 0:34:36.264
They will not be satisfied
with anything less than the child.

0:34:36.347 --> 0:34:37.891
This is unacceptable.

0:34:37.974 --> 0:34:40.560
I will eliminate the enemy
and you will escape.

0:34:40.643 --> 0:34:42.812
You don't have
that kind of firepower, pal.

0:34:42.896 --> 0:34:44.480
You wouldn't even get to daylight.

0:34:44.564 --> 0:34:45.815
That is not my objective.

0:34:46.232 --> 0:34:48.985
We're getting close. Saddle up.

0:34:50.695 --> 0:34:53.948
I still have the security protocols
from my manufacturer.

0:34:54.032 --> 0:34:57.202
If my designs are compromised,
I must self-destruct.

0:34:57.285 --> 0:34:58.828
What're you talking about?

0:34:58.912 --> 0:35:01.414
I am not permitted to be captured.
I must be destroyed.

0:35:01.539 --> 0:35:03.833
Are we gonna keep talking,
or get out of here?

0:35:04.626 --> 0:35:06.377
I can no longer carry this for you.

0:35:08.713 --> 0:35:10.048
Nor can I watch over the child.

0:35:10.673 --> 0:35:13.051
Wait. You can't self-destruct.

0:35:13.134 --> 0:35:14.928
Your base command is to watch the child.

0:35:15.011 --> 0:35:17.347
That supersedes
your manufacturer's protocol, right?

0:35:18.389 --> 0:35:19.974
- Right?
- This is correct.

0:35:20.058 --> 0:35:22.685
Good. Now, grab a blaster
and help us shoot our way out.

0:35:22.769 --> 0:35:24.479
Victory through combat
is impossible.

0:35:24.562 --> 0:35:27.315
We will be captured.
The child will be lost.

0:35:27.398 --> 0:35:31.194
Sadly, there is no scenario where
the child is saved, in which I survive.

What're you doing?

0:36:43.641 --> 0:36:47.061
Manufacturer's protocol dictates
I cannot be captured.

0:36:49.105 --> 0:36:50.440
I must be destroyed.

0:37:25.642 --> 0:37:26.768
Moff Gideon!

0:37:41.366 --> 0:37:43.326
- He missed!
- He won't next time.

0:37:43.409 --> 0:37:45.286
Our blasters are useless against him.

Let's make the baby do
the magic hand thing.

0:37:47.413 --> 0:37:49.499
Come on, baby! Do the magic hand thing.

0:37:53.670 --> 0:37:55.713
- I'm out of ideas.
- I'm not.

0:37:55.797 --> 0:37:57.257
Here he comes!

0:39:17.212 --> 0:39:18.213
No!

0:39:40.151 --> 0:39:43.655
That was impressive, Mando.
Very impressive.

It looks like your Guild rates
have just gone up.

Any more stormtroopers?

I think we cleaned up the town.

0:39:52.789 --> 0:39:54.832
I'm thinking of staying around
just to be sure.

- You're staying here?
- Well, why not?

0:40:00.129 --> 0:40:02.465
Nevarro is a very fine planet.

0:40:02.549 --> 0:40:05.635
And now that the scum and villainy
have been washed away,

0:40:05.718 --> 0:40:07.428
it's very respectable again.

0:40:07.512 --> 0:40:09.305

And perhaps, this specimen of soldier
might consider joining our ranks.

0:40:18.982 --> 0:40:22.485
Yeah. I've got some clerical
concerns regarding my chain code.

0:40:22.569 --> 0:40:24.654
And if you would agree
to become my enforcer,

0:40:24.737 --> 0:40:28.032
clerical concerns would be
the least of your worries.

0:40:28.116 --> 0:40:33.496
But you, my friend, you will be welcome
back into the Guild with open arms.

0:40:33.580 --> 0:40:35.874
So, go off, enjoy yourself.

0:40:36.666 --> 0:40:40.753
And when you're ready to return,
you will have the pick of all quarries.

0:40:47.677 --> 0:40:50.263
I'm afraid I have
more pressing matters at hand.

0:40:56.769 --> 0:40:58.521
Take care of this little one.

0:41:01.316 --> 0:41:04.777
Or maybe, it'll take care of you.

0:42:03.586 --> 0:42:05.004
What do you got there?

0:42:18.768 --> 0:42:20.270
I didn't think I'd see this again.

0:42:25.900 --> 0:42:27.986
Why don't you hang onto that?
