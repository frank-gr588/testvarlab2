1
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,068
That's it.

2
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:31,698
Can I just, you know,
look at it for a minute?

3
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:34,701
You're an artist, Sid.

4
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,122
You're telling me
you're just gonna walk out of here

5
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:41,166
and I'm never going
to see it again?

6
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:42,792
There's a good chance
of that, yes.

7
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,879
Most guys, you know,
for the first one,

8
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:47,589
they start
with something small.

9
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:50,258
"Mom," girlfriend's initials,
something like that.

10
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:53,219
Not you.

11
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,514
You get a full set of sleeves,
all in a couple of months.

12
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,933
Takes guys a few years
to get the ink you got.

13
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,062
I don't have
a few years.

14
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,398
Wish to hell I did.

15
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:00,829
The vault. Open it.

16
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,997
We can't. The branch
manager's not here.

17
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,876
-Where is he?
-It's lunchtime.

18
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,044
He's at White Castle.

19
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,337
White Castle?

20
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,463
It's a fast food restaurant.

21
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,508
They serve
those little square burgers.

22
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,301
I know what it is.

23
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:19,055
I'm not playing games.

24
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,557
Open it.

25
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,809
Sir, you have a half
a million dollars cash in your bag.

26
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,727
Don't you think
it would be better...

27
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,240
This is the police.

28
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,659
You are completely surrounded.

29
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,246
Put down your weapon.

30
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,667
Put down your weapons now.

31
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,840
Rarely in the case
of armed robbery

32
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,925
do we hear a plea
of no contest.

33
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,052
Are you sure about this,
Mr. Scofield?

34
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,637
I'm sure, Your Honor.

35
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,848
Your Honor, we'd like
to recess if we could.

36
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,766
My client's a bit confused
at the moment.

37
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,684
I'm not, Your Honor.

38
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,060
He is, Your Honor.

39
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,563
Perhaps you should heed
your representation's advice,

40
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:11,274
take some additional time
to consider your response.

41
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,650
I've already done that,
Your Honor.

42
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,868
I'll retire to my chambers
to determine sentencing.

43
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,786
Court's recessed until 1:30.

44
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,040
Come on, let's go.

45
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,166
Uncle Mike?

46
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,003
I didn't want you to come.

47
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,297
Go home, LJ.

48
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,299
I didn't want you
to see this.

49
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,058
He's not gonna
take this well.

50
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:47,018
Can you blame him?
He's your nephew.

51
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,102
He's beginning
to get the idea

52
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,729
that anybody
he attaches himself to

53
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,648
is gonna
end up in prison...

54
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:52,649
And he's not the only one

55
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,108
who's starting to feel
that way, Michael.

56
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,403
Will you give us a minute?

57
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,446
One minute.

58
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:00,782
Don't you understand?

59
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,367
You just put the book
in that woman's hand

60
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,577
and she's gonna lob it
at you like a grenade.

61
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,121
Justice and punishment
are the same thing to her.

62
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,539
I know.

63
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,917
Then will you please tell me
what's going through your head?

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,043
We've been over this.

65
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:13,419
I've known you
my entire life.

66
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,838
You don't have
a violent bone in your body,

67
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,799
and I know you didn't
need the money.

68
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:18,758
Veronica.

69
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,760
Why won't you
let me help you?

70
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,053
You've been good to me.

71
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,763
My whole life, you have.

72
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,349
But you've gotta let me
deal with this.

73
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,434
Okay?

74
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,770
Given your lack
of prior criminal conduct,

75
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,940
I am inclined
toward probation.

76
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:36,150
However, the fact that
you discharged a deadly weapon

77
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:39,112
during the commission
of the crime suggests malice to me.

78
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,364
For that reason,
I find it incumbent

79
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,242
that you see the inside
of a prison cell, Mr. Scofield.

80
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,954
It says here
that you've requested to be incarcerated

81
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:50,123
somewhere near your home
here in Chicago.

82
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,791
I'm willing to honor that.

83
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,376
The closest
level one facility to--

84
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,294
Level one?

85
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,254
That's maximum security,
Your Honor.

86
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:59,590
I would ask counsel to refrain
from interrupting me.

87
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:00,633
As I was saying,

88
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,135
the closest
level one facility

89
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,220
would be Fox River
State Penitentiary.

90
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,888
As for the term
of your sentence,

91
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,473
I'm setting it
at five years.

92
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,976
You'll be eligible for parole
in half that time.

93
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:12,437
Sentence to be carried out immediately.

94
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,119
Okay, step inside the door
and check yourself for bugs.

95
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,662
When you hear
the knock, step out.

96
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,039
Keep the line moving.

97
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,166
We ain't got all day
to get this done.

98
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,667
- Let's go. Move it.
- No more talking in line.

99
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,794
Move it. You got less
than five minutes to take a shower.

100
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,421
Keep the line moving.
Keep it moving.

101
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:41,049
- Move it. Right now. Let's go. Move, move.
- Next!

102
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,553
Name and back number.

103
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:46,888
Scofield, Michael.

104
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:47,930
94941.

105
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,557
Are you
a religious man, Scofield?

106
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,641
Never really
thought about it.

107
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:51,726
Good, 'cause
the Ten Commandments

108
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:52,935
don't mean
a box of piss in here.

109
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,145
We got two commandments
and two only.

110
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,898
The first commandment
is you got nothing coming.

111
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,358
What's the second commandment?

112
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,525
See commandment number one.

113
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,152
Gotcha.

114
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,988
You talking out the side
of your neck?

115
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,573
Come again?

116
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:08,576
I said, are you
being a smartass?

117
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:11,079
Just trying to fly low,
avoid the radar, boss.

118
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,955
Do my time... and get out.

119
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,125
There isn't any flying
under my radar.

120
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,127
Good to know.

121
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,609
Hey, can a brother
get some air conditioning up here, cuz?

122
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:43,778
It's hotter than
a crack ho's mouth, man.

123
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:46,197
To hell with the AC, man.
Give me the crack ho.

124
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,910
Come on!

125
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,248
Yo, Fish!

126
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,707
What you looking at?

127
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,835
You look kind of pretty
to be up in here, man.

128
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:00,711
Fish!

129
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:03,965
I suggest you
take a seat, Fish.

130
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,885
Ain't nothing to do up in here
but serve time.

131
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,929
Ain't nobody
gonna serve it for you.

132
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,238
Welcome to
Prisneyland, Fish.

133
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,747
...is now
on mandatory lockdown...

134
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,975
You wanna talk
about it?

135
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:57,685
No, it's not
worth talking about.

136
00:07:57,768 --> 00:08:00,021
If it's keeping you up,
it is.

137
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,689
Oh, it's just...

138
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,733
It's nothing, you know.

139
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:05,943
Michael's case.

140
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,529
You did the best you could.

141
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,114
Yeah, but he didn't.

142
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,408
He just sort of rolled over.

143
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,118
He didn't put up a fight.

144
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,077
It's not like him.

145
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,290
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
be talking about him.

146
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:22,293
Hey, if it's on your mind,
it's on your mind, right?

147
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:25,671
Good night.

148
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:37,266
All wings, guard coming out.

149
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,310
All wings,
guard coming out.

150
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,149
Trey Street Deuces
got the hoops.

151
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,652
Nortenos got the bleachers.

152
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,779
Woods got the weight pile.

153
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,657
The C.O.s got the rest.

154
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,452
I'm telling you, the guards
are the dirtiest gang in this whole place.

155
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,329
The only difference
between us and them...

156
00:08:58,412 --> 00:08:59,997
is the badge.

157
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,040
Who's the pet lover?

158
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,917
He'll deny it,
but he's D.B. Cooper.

159
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,088
Parachuted out of a plane
30 years ago with a million and a half in cash.

160
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,839
Doesn't look
like the type.

161
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:09,924
Who does?

162
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:12,176
Hey! What up, Wholesale?

163
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,928
-You okay?
-Gonna be greater later.

164
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:14,845
Yeah.

165
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,472
What you doing
with this fish, man?

166
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,974
-He's my new cellie.
-Huh.

167
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,935
Wholesale's got it wired up
at the commissary.

168
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:22,812
Anything you want,
he can get it for you.

169
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,272
You keep
handing out my jacket,

170
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,731
I swear I'm gonna
bust your grape.

171
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,775
Man, you couldn't bust a grape in Napa
with a set of cleats on.

172
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,694
-What are you talking about?
-Man, you want to bump your gums.

173
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,904
Oh, no, no. Now you're
talking, talking, talking...

174
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,350
I'm looking for someone.

175
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,687
Guy named Lincoln Burrows.

176
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,105
Linc the Sink?

177
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,607
That what
they're calling him now?

178
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,275
Yeah.

179
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,277
As in, he'll come at you
with everything but the kitchen...

180
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,486
Snowflake.

181
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,988
Where can I find him?

182
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,533
Man killed
the Vice President's brother.

183
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,035
In a month,
he's getting the chair,

184
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,787
which means no one up this river
is more dangerous than him,

185
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,205
'cause he's got
nothing to lose now.

186
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,458
What are they gonna do?
Kill him twice?

187
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,417
There a way
I can get to him?

188
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,336
Oh, no. The only time
those boys get out

189
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,879
is for chapel and P.I.

190
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:32,173
P.I.? What's that?

191
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,174
Prison Industry.

192
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,967
The guys that get along
get to work.

193
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:39,513
You know, painting, scrapping,
making mattresses, you name it.

194
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,682
I wouldn't get excited, though,
if I were you, Fish.

195
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,225
You ain't sniffin'
none of P.I.

196
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,685
Why's that?

197
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,354
'Cause John Abruzzi runs it.

198
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,814
"John Abruzzi" John Abruzzi?

199
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,108
"John Abruzzi" John Abruzzi.

200
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,277
Why you wanna see Burrows
so bad anyhow?

201
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,574
Because he's my brother.

202
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:22,807
They denied the motion.

203
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:23,808
Then do it again.

204
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:24,850
I can't. That's it.

205
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,019
May 11th.
That's the date, man.

206
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,604
That's the date they,
uh, you know...

207
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,356
execute me.

208
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,108
I know.

209
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,657
I didn't
kill that man, Michael.

210
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,117
The evidence says you did.

211
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,660
I don't care
what the evidence says.

212
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:43,619
I didn't kill him.

213
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,080
Swear to me.

214
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,542
I swear to you, Michael.

215
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:57,925
But how did they get it wrong then?

216
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,468
The courts,
the appeals.

217
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,929
Don't know. Don't know.

218
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,889
All I keep thinking,
looking back on it is, uh...

219
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,015
I was set up.

220
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:07,393
And whoever it was
that set me up

221
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,562
wants me in the ground
as quickly as possible.

222
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,861
What's another word
for "love"?

223
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,237
What's the context?

224
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,572
Oh, you know.

225
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:20,990
The "I love you so much

226
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,826
I ain't never knocking over
a liquor store again" context.

227
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,327
Except, you know, classy.

228
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,246
Mmm.

229
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,206
I'm proposing to my girl,
if you gotta know.

230
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:30,583
In a letter?

231
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:31,500
You got a better way?

232
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,294
Face-to-face
works pretty good.

233
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:36,505
This place ain't exactly
the romantic spot.

234
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,924
I'm gonna have her get
on the Staten Island Ferry.

235
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,552
Then, once she can see
the Empire State Building,

236
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:42,928
she opens the letter...

237
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,097
It's like almost being there.

238
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,891
Except for the fact
that I won't be there.

239
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,143
Try "passion."

240
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,103
Ooh! Ooh! "Passion."
"Passion." That's dope.

241
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,022
Passion.

242
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,775
How do you spell that?

243
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,610
-Is it P-A-S-H?
-Uh-uh.

244
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:00,404
No "H"?

245
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,287
LJ, hold up.

246
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,955
Hold up.

247
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,041
I don't think I can
go through with this.

248
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,542
Everything's going
to be fine.

249
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:15,753
Trust me.

250
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,139
We understand
each other, then?

251
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,224
-Yeah.
-Friday.

252
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,559
Not Saturday.
Not Sunday. Friday.

253
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,144
It's totally understood.

254
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,896
I don't want hundreds,
I don't want fives, I don't want ones.

255
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:34,897
I know, I know.

256
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,148
Tens and 20s only.

257
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,535
It's on.

258
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,674
Police!

259
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:27,283
Abruzzi, I need you
to hire me a P.I.

260
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,078
Beat it.

261
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,997
Maybe you ought to hear
what I got to say.

262
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,540
You got nothing I need.

263
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,544
Wouldn't be
too sure of that.

264
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,171
My mistake.

265
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:45,092
Just what I need... a duck.

266
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,428
P.I., Abruzzi.

267
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:50,139
You might find I can be
of more assistance than you think.

268
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,310
Mull it over.

269
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,271
Come find me
when you're ready to talk.

270
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,780
All right, guys,
pick it up!

271
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,324
I want to get home tonight!

272
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:09,700
Maggio.

273
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,042
Yeah? So?

274
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,752
That's the son of a bitch
that fingered Abruzzi.

275
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,171
That's Fibonacci?

276
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,716
I thought the punk
was gone forever.

277
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,718
Evidently,
somebody found him.

278
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,803
Somebody messing with us?

279
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,430
This you're not
going to believe.

280
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,477
What is it?

281
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,817
Tattoo looks fresh.
Hold that.

282
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,571
I guess, being a diabetic,
you don't mind needles.

283
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,990
I'm Michael, by the way.

284
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,784
Scofield.
I read your report.

285
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:53,994
And you are?

286
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,871
Dr. Tancredi will do.

287
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,331
"Tancredi" like the governor?

288
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,793
You're not related,
are you?

289
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,838
Hmm. Wouldn't think
you'd find the daughter

290
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,424
of Frontier Justice Frank
working in a prison.

291
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:10,177
As a doctor, no less.

292
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,305
I believe in being part
of the solution, not the problem.

293
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:17,601
Hmm. "Be the change you want
to see in the world."

294
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:22,439
What?

295
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,110
Nothing. That was just
my senior quote.

296
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,653
That was you?

297
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,697
This whole time,
I was thinking it was Gandhi.

298
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,366
You're very funny.

299
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,493
Sit tight.
Put direct pressure on that.

300
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:35,619
I'll be back
in a sec.

301
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:51,885
So, how do we play this?

302
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,096
You hook me up
with a few weeks' supply?

303
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,724
Nice try.
No hypos on the floor.

304
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,852
I'm the farthest thing
from a junkie. Trust me.

305
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,228
I got news
for you, Michael.

306
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,564
"Trust me" means absolutely zero
inside these walls.

307
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:05,149
The only way
you're getting that insulin

308
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:07,276
is if I'm administering it.

309
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,570
Guess we'll be seeing
a lot of each other, then, huh?

310
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:11,447
I guess so.

311
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,628
We're all clear
on the Burrows execution.

312
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,338
-Good.
-Except for one thing.

313
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,632
Bishop McMorrow
is not in the fold.

314
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,888
He's got a lot of influence
with the governor.

315
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,806
They went to prep school
together, apparently.

316
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:42,102
Look, the closer it gets,
the more I'm worried

317
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,396
that the bottom is going
to fall out of this whole thing.

318
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,528
Well, maybe it's time you arranged a visit
with the good bishop, then.

319
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:57,743
Look, in one month,
it'll all be over.

320
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:02,206
"The Son of Man must be delivered
into the hands of sinful men

321
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:06,168
and be crucified
and the third day, rise again."

322
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:10,047
And they remembered His words,
and so should you.

323
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,299
Good day, gentlemen.
May God be with you.

324
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,389
Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

325
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,063
Michael.

326
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,818
Let's go. Come on, man.
Keep moving.

327
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,236
Keep moving.
Move. Come on.

328
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,154
- Why?
- Let's go, man. Come on.

329
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,156
I'm getting you
out of here.

330
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,408
Burrows, roll it up.
Happy hour's over.

331
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,994
It's impossible.

332
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,663
Not if you designed
the place, it isn't.

333
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:52,589
Too formal.

334
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,177
Too "greeting card."

335
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,679
Well, we got
to make a decision

336
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,347
sooner or later,
you know.

337
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,306
We have time.

338
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,268
We don't, actually.

339
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:07,771
I mean, at some point,
we got to pull the trigger on this thing.

340
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,356
I don't want
to rush this.

341
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,649
We're only going
to do it once.

342
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:11,733
We have to
get it right.

343
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:20,284
Honey, can I
ask you something?

344
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:21,285
Of course.

345
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,704
Are you putting this off?

346
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,038
What do you mean?

347
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,040
I mean, are you
having second thoughts?

348
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,085
No. Honey, no.

349
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:31,670
I'm not.

350
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,714
I don't know.

351
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:36,133
-I just can't help thinking this is about--
-It's not.

352
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,136
I love you.

353
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,722
And I want
to be your wife.

354
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,144
Passion?

355
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:48,228
What were you thinking?

356
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,396
Hey, you went for it.

357
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,565
She probably thinks
I went sissy up in here.

358
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:56,111
"Passion." You know,
got more than one syllable, too much talkin'.

359
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,322
That's me from now on.
One-syllable Sucre.

360
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,574
Yes. No. Love.

361
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,075
Hate. Love.

362
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,410
Give it time.

363
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,745
Are you kidding?

364
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,121
I proposed to her.

365
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,581
That doesn't take time.

366
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:08,916
Si or no.

367
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,083
One syllable, man.

368
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:14,504
She's supposed
to come around

369
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,173
for a conjugal on Tuesday.

370
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:17,633
She's always
calling me beforehand,

371
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,718
letting me know
she's coming.

372
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:22,346
This time, man,
I ain't heard a peep.

373
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:24,848
You spooked her.

374
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:26,934
Scofield.

375
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:29,228
Get it together.
Pope wants to see you.

376
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:35,025
No good, Fish.

377
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:37,152
No one gets an audience
with the Pope.

378
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,988
Not unless he's real interested
in what you got going on.

379
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,408
Top of your class at Loyola.

380
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:46,453
Magna cum laude, in fact.

381
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:49,373
I can't help wondering
what someone with your credentials

382
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,041
is doing in a place like this.

383
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:55,128
Took a wrong turn
a few months back, I guess.

384
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,256
You make it sound
like a traffic infraction.

385
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,509
Like all you did was turn the wrong way
up a one-way street.

386
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,719
Everyone turns up one
sooner or later.

387
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,642
The reason
I called you here...

388
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:11,645
I noticed in your I-file,
under occupation,

389
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,772
you put down "unemployed."

390
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,983
That's not true, now, is it?

391
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:22,322
I know you're
a structural engineer, Scofield.

392
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,078
Shah Jahan
built the Taj Majal

393
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:31,832
as a monument
to his undying love for his wife.

394
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:34,668
My wife is quite fond
of the story.

395
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,753
It appeals
to the romantic in her.

396
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:42,676
Being married to someone
in Corrections, terrible job.

397
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,219
Wouldn't wish it on anyone.

398
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:47,097
And yet, in 39 years,

399
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,808
my wife
has never complained.

400
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:52,227
And the worst part of it is,
I've never thanked her.

401
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,149
So, because
I couldn't say it,

402
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:59,318
I thought, you know,
I could build it.

403
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,405
Come June,
it's our 40th anniversary.

404
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,534
But here, look.

405
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:08,994
You see,
the problem is,

406
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,079
I build anymore,

407
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,207
it's all gonna come down
like a house of cards.

408
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:17,377
That's where I was hoping
you could be of assistance.

409
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,837
For the favor,
I can offer you

410
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,631
three days of work
a week in here.

411
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,675
And it'll keep you
off the yard.

412
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:27,846
Mmm.

413
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:31,975
I can't do it.

414
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:37,397
Son, it's better for me
to owe you one in here

415
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,774
than it is for you
to owe me one,

416
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,317
I can promise you that.

417
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:42,319
I'll take my chances.

418
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:46,782
Then we're through here.

419
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:49,117
Guard!

420
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:54,247
Two pounds of pot?

421
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,957
What were you trying to do,
set a record?

422
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,043
It's not funny, LJ.

423
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,669
You could be going
to jail.

424
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:03,673
It's pretty obvious to me
you need some guidance.

425
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:06,802
Hey.

426
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:08,678
Thanks.

427
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:12,349
From who,
old Daddy Warbucks?

428
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:14,309
Give him a chance.
He's a good man.

429
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,311
We got nothing in common.

430
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,688
Come on. Where is this
coming from, LJ?

431
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:21,650
Last semester you were getting
almost all A's and now...

432
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,905
It's your father, isn't it?

433
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:28,198
I don't have a father.

434
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:30,200
It wasn't an immaculate
conception, honey.

435
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:31,493
Trust me.

436
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,373
Maybe it's time
we went and saw him.

437
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:38,667
Mom...

438
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:39,960
Mom.

439
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:41,795
Don't.

440
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:43,255
I'm about as excited
by the prospect as you are,

441
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:45,006
but something's gotta give.

442
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,425
You have got
too much potential

443
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,385
to be screwing up
your life like this.

444
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:56,435
What if they'd sent you
to Taylorville or Marion and not here?

445
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:59,020
I think I'd be doing
the same thing I'm doing in here.

446
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,273
Eating Jell-O,
drinking Kool-Aid...

447
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:03,024
I know what you're doing.

448
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,652
It's not the luck of the draw
that you're in here with Lincoln.

449
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,029
You forget I know you.

450
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,531
Both of you.

451
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:12,826
You two have the most
dysfunctional idea of love I've ever seen.

452
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:15,454
What, he beats you up
to keep you off the streets,

453
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,831
so you get yourself tossed
into Fox River with him?

454
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,666
To what?

455
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:20,834
Save him?

456
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,171
I deserve to know.

457
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,131
I loved him
as much as you did.

458
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:29,468
Past tense for you, maybe.
Not me.

459
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:32,596
I gave him a shot
when I got back from college. I did.

460
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:34,347
Even with all the stuff
that was going on with him,

461
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,141
I did everything I could
to make it work.

462
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:37,434
And he threw it away.

463
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,144
You ever think maybe he was hurt
that you left

464
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,353
in the first place?

465
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,939
Don't do this.

466
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,816
Whatever it is you're doing,
don't do it.

467
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,859
There's a better way.

468
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,110
I'm already appealing
your case.

469
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,945
I told you
to leave that alone.

470
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,780
I've gotten in touch with the diocese about Lincoln.
The bishop may be able to help.

471
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:53,074
That won't stop it.
It'll only delay it.

472
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:59,498
You want
to do something?

473
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,333
You find out
who's trying to bury him.

474
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:06,338
Nobody's trying to bury him.

475
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,048
The evidence was there.

476
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:09,591
The evidence was cooked.

477
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:14,930
Visiting hours
are now over.

478
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,353
Take care of yourself.

479
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:25,482
Someone wants him
dead, Veronica.

480
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:27,567
Something more
is going on here.

481
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:29,611
This is desperation, Michael.

482
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,738
You're grabbing at straws.
You're in denial.

483
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:32,656
Maybe.

484
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:33,990
But I can't watch him die.

485
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:35,742
I won't do that.

486
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,232
Gentlemen...

487
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:10,151
What is it about the Burrows situation
that I can help you with?

488
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:13,154
It's our understanding
that you have great influence with the governor.

489
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:17,742
I wouldn't say it's "great" or "influence."

490
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,077
We're friends.

491
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,038
It's also our understanding
that you oppose the death penalty.

492
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,873
I'm a man of God.
How could I not?

493
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:27,168
In this case, we're hoping
you'll suspend that position.

494
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,878
At least temporarily.

495
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:32,966
If the inmate appeals
to me for intervention,

496
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,509
how can I
turn my back on him?

497
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:37,554
You have a habit of answering
a question with a question.

498
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:40,932
And you have a way of asking questions
that beg more questions.

499
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:47,147
Are you saying
you won't do it?

500
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,898
I'm not a man to equivocate.

501
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:55,822
You're, what, 62 years old now,
Your Excellency.

502
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:56,823
That's right.

503
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:58,283
I would assume, then,
that you'd be well-versed

504
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:00,285
in how our government's
tax system works.

505
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:02,037
Taking personal
capital gains

506
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,247
under the church's
tax shelter...

507
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:06,374
that would be fraud,
wouldn't it, Your Excellency?

508
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:11,463
I will not be cowed
into forsaking my beliefs.

509
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,923
Not by you or anyone else.

510
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,468
Admirable.

511
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,887
Good day, Excellency.

512
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:20,889
Mr. Kellerman...

513
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:26,645
What is it about this case
that the Secret Service is so interested in?

514
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,813
The man killed
the Vice President's brother.

515
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:37,947
What'd you say?

516
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,032
You heard me.

517
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:40,700
Someone found Fibonacci.

518
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:42,702
I'm looking at the photos
right now.

519
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:45,205
Son of a bitch
has got a beard, sunglasses...

520
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,956
Witness protection,
if I ever saw it.

521
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,875
Who was this someone?

522
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:51,086
Don't know, there's no return address
on the envelope.

523
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,047
Just...

524
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,675
this folded-up bird
made of paper.

525
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,387
Like origami?

526
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,596
Yeah, like that.

527
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,598
Like origami.

528
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,009
You're Charles Westmoreland,
right?

529
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,136
Do I know you?

530
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,388
I knew your wife
before she passed.

531
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:44,931
You knew Marla?

532
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:45,932
You mean Ann?

533
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,268
How'd you know her?

534
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:50,228
We taught together
in Boston.

535
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:51,354
East Farmington.

536
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:52,647
You mean West Wilmington?

537
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:55,316
No more tests.

538
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:56,901
I promise.

539
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,988
Seems you know
everything about me.

540
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:01,531
Who are you?

541
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:02,490
Michael Scofield.

542
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:05,118
How'd you get it in here?

543
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:07,328
First off,
she's not an "it."

544
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,581
She's Marilyn,
and she's grandfathered

545
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:13,835
back from the days
when prisoners were allowed a creature comfort or two.

546
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:16,212
I heard
you were D.B. Cooper.

547
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:20,091
Every new fish
comes in here,

548
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,301
first thing they hear,

549
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:24,262
is that Charles Westmoreland
is D.B. Cooper.

550
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,139
I'll tell you
like I tell them...

551
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,434
You want the Cooper story?

552
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:32,771
I can't give it to you,
'cause I'm not him.

553
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:33,688
It's too bad.

554
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,523
Sort of wish it was true.

555
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:36,941
The man's a legend.

556
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,944
Nowhere near as much
as I wish it were true, friend.

557
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,864
I'd have a million-five
waiting for me on the outside.

558
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:48,203
I'd put some grass
under 'em if I were you.

559
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:52,207
This thing would go
a whole lot easier if you'd just hire me.

560
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,751
What is this all about?

561
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:57,837
Say you were able
to get outside those walls...

562
00:29:58,755 --> 00:29:59,839
would you have
the people in place

563
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,966
to make sure
you disappeared forever?

564
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,009
What do you care?

565
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:04,969
Just curious.

566
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,638
Where's Fibonacci?

567
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,223
That's not the way
it works.

568
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:15,897
They come at me, John,
I'm coming after you.

569
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:18,107
I doubt it.

570
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,111
Fight, fight, fight...

571
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:46,928
All right.

572
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:54,310
Get on the ground.

573
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,940
I totally
misjudged you, Scofield.

574
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,401
I didn't think
you were the agitating type.

575
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:04,404
Behavior like that
will not be tolerated in my prison.

576
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:05,613
Ninety days in the SHU!

577
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,699
That ought to be enough time
to convince you of that fact.

578
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:08,616
Ninety days?

579
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,576
That's right.

580
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:19,294
Something you want to say?

581
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:22,046
It's just...

582
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,756
I'm not of much value
to you in the SHU.

583
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,258
Value?

584
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,385
Hmm... The Taj.

585
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:29,470
It'd be a shame
for the eighth wonder of the modern world

586
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:32,682
to collapse because the stress
isn't properly propagated.

587
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:33,850
Properly propagated?

588
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,643
Properly propagated.

589
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,270
The joints are overloaded.

590
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:39,647
They won't provide anywhere
near the sheer strength

591
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,149
the completed structure
will need.

592
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:44,319
How much work
are we talking?

593
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,362
You want it by when, June?

594
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,488
Yes.

595
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:50,158
Then we'd better get started,
wouldn't you say?

596
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:18,436
Who's there?

597
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,831
Bishop McMorrow
was killed last night.

598
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,541
Someone shot him
while he was sleeping.

599
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:43,252
I thought
you'd want to know.

600
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,796
Thanks.

601
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:53,680
Michael was right.

602
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,128
Sink, you got a visitor.

603
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,392
He was arrested.

604
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,186
For what?

605
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,688
Possession of marijuana.

606
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:50,111
I figured he could use
some fatherly advice before it's...

607
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,614
-Gone forever?
-I didn't mean that.

608
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,033
I know you didn't.

609
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:56,200
Thanks, Lisa.

610
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:59,120
Sit down.

611
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,126
Dope, huh?

612
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:07,003
Using or dealing?

613
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:09,881
What's the difference?

614
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:13,301
Then what, you, uh, think it gives you
some kind of street cred?

615
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,554
You got a piece
of the good life.

616
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:17,638
Take advantage.

617
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:20,475
Look, I get it.

618
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,143
The whole thing.

619
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,145
She drags me in here,

620
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,605
you give me a big speech,

621
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,690
I walk away a changed man.

622
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,025
Straight A's.

623
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:31,944
Harvard.
Grow up and be a dentist.

624
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,279
It's better than being here.

625
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:37,075
You got to realize
who's getting punished

626
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,910
when you're doing
the things you're doing.

627
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,745
You think it's me.
It's you.

628
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:42,205
I did the same thing.

629
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:43,748
Punished the old man
'cause he was gone.

630
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:44,749
Look what it got me.

631
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:51,380
I'm not asking you
to love me.

632
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:54,383
I already screwed up
that chance long ago.

633
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:56,677
I'm asking you
to love yourself.

634
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,679
You can still put the brakes
on this thing.

635
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:03,017
So, that's what
fatherly advice is like.

636
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:05,520
Where are you going?

637
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:08,064
I got homework.

638
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:11,067
They're putting me
to death, LJ.

639
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,735
In a month's time,
I'll be dead.

640
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:14,737
You get that?

641
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:18,199
You're already
dead to me.

642
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,518
Yes.

643
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:48,521
What? You mean "yes," yes?

644
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:49,647
Yes!

645
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,023
- Yeah!
- Yes!

646
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,570
-Oh, there's just one thing.
-Of course.

647
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,029
Mama wants us to wait
till you get out.

648
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,197
Of course, mi amor.

649
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,490
Oh, and we have
to get married in a church.

650
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,659
-Okay. Esta bien.
-A Catholic church.

651
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:03,953
Wouldn't want to mess
with the Catholic roots, would we?

652
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:11,836
You went to Loyola.

653
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,337
You've been
checking up on me.

654
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,256
I like to get to know
my patients.

655
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:17,341
I went to Northwestern.
Graduated two years after you did.

656
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,969
Maybe we met before,
you know, drunk,

657
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,429
out at a bar somewhere.

658
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,597
I would have remembered.

659
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,265
-That a compliment?
-No.

660
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:26,601
Hmm.

661
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,020
What?

662
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:31,772
Your blood glucose is at
50 milligrams per deciliter.

663
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,900
-So?
-That's hypoglycemic.

664
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,526
Your body's reacting
to the insulin

665
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,694
like you're not a diabetic.

666
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:38,779
You're sure it's type 1 diabetes
you've got?

667
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,156
Ever since I was a kid.

668
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,533
All right.

669
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,368
Not experiencing
any tingling sensation, cold sweats--

670
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,124
Infirmary.

671
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,417
Yes.

672
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,420
Yeah. I did.

673
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:58,633
No, I did and I do.
I need them.

674
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:02,386
Okay. Um, great.
Well, I'll call him after lunch, then.

675
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,347
Thanks.
I'm with a patient. Okay.

676
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,808
I'd like to run some tests
next time you're in.

677
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:11,145
Last thing I want is to be
administering insulin to a man who doesn't need it.

678
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,064
Yeah, sure.

679
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,024
Okay.

680
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,199
How'd you get here,
by the way?

681
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,159
Oh, you know.

682
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,745
I don't.
That's why I asked.

683
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:30,414
You know. Hector.

684
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:31,415
What?

685
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,125
I didn't have any money
for the bus,

686
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:34,585
so he offered me a ride.

687
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,420
He was really sweet.

688
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:39,966
Honey, he's just a friend.

689
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:41,050
No, he's not
just a friend.

690
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:43,010
I know Hector.
I know men.

691
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,303
Men and women
can't be friends.

692
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:47,139
A guy doesn't drive a girl
500 miles across state lines

693
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,349
because he wants
to be friends.

694
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,393
Casanova, wrap it up.

695
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:55,147
Hey, you got nothing
to worry about, okay?

696
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,275
It's you I'm marrying.

697
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,110
It's not you
I'm worried about.

698
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:03,197
Sixteen more months.

699
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,332
I love you.

700
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,054
Be easy, son, all right?

701
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:35,062
Sucre tells me
you're the local pharmacy.

702
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,277
-What you need, man?
-PUGNAc.

703
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,529
I only speak English,
white boy.

704
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:44,822
It's an insulin blocker.

705
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:46,532
Standard
over-the-counter variety.

706
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:47,700
You can get it
at any pharmacy.

707
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:49,118
You can get that
at medical then.

708
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,578
I can't get it at medical.

709
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,288
Why not?

710
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:54,415
Because they're already
giving me insulin shots.

711
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,836
You're one mixed-up cracker,
you know that?

712
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:00,296
Can you get it for me,
or not?

713
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:03,215
Only if you tell me
why is it you want

714
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:04,508
to keep going
back up to medical

715
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,510
to get an insulin shot
for which you don't need.

716
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:08,721
I like the ambiance.

717
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:09,972
Uh-huh.

718
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:11,724
Are we in business?

719
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,731
All personnel,

720
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:21,025
Facility Two lockdown
in 20 minutes.

721
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:24,070
Facility One lockdown
in ten minutes.

722
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,742
Scofield. I don't know
what you did,

723
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:32,244
but Abruzzi wanted me
to give you this P.I. card.

724
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:33,954
Congratulations.

725
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:36,082
You just joined the ranks
of the employed.

726
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,016
Kudos, Fish.

727
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,018
You got spine.

728
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:04,026
All right, cons,
break it down!

729
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:07,738
Move it, guys.

730
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:22,128
Saw Veronica
came by yesterday.

731
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:23,337
Still engaged to that guy?

732
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,296
Yup.

733
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:25,965
Could have been me.

734
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,550
If you hadn't
self-destructed.

735
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,886
You think I meant
to knock up Lisa Rix?

736
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:32,847
I was just being stupid.

737
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,098
Hurt.

738
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,101
Shouldn't have
pushed her away, though.

739
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:38,310
You pushed everyone away.

740
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:41,480
I'm an anchor.

741
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,274
All I'll do
is drag him down with me.

742
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:50,281
Why did you hire him?

743
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:51,740
Keep your friends close

744
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,826
and your enemies closer.

745
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:00,583
You mean
what you said earlier?

746
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,793
I'm not here on vacation,
trust me.

747
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:06,755
Getting outside these walls,
that's just the beginning.

748
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:08,799
You're going to need money.

749
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,888
I'll have it.

750
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,681
And people
on the outside...

751
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:17,308
People that can
help you disappear.

752
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,518
I've already got them.

753
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:21,896
They just
don't know it yet.

754
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:29,195
Look, whatever you got
going on, fill me in,

755
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:30,321
'cause I'm in the dark here.

756
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:34,325
Chaparral Associates
got the contract

757
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:36,118
to retrofit
this place in '99.

758
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:37,536
Four million dollar contract.

759
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,205
Head partner
couldn't crack it.

760
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:42,333
So, he subcontracted out,
an under-the-table sort of deal

761
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:43,584
with a former associate.

762
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,253
That guy was one
of the partners in my firm.

763
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:50,090
We basically ghost-wrote
the whole plan.

764
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,885
Crossed the t's, dotted the i's,
grouted the tiles.

765
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:03,896
You've seen the blueprints.

766
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:05,022
Better than that.

767
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:07,900
I've got them on me.

768
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,572
Are you kidding me?

769
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:19,078
Am I supposed to be seeing
something here?

770
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:20,287
Look closer.

771
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:39,158
Captioned by Point.360.
