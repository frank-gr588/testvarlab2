WEBVTT

0:00:00.010 --> 0:00:03.006
The Empire is gone, Mando.

0:00:04.081 --> 0:00:07.065
This asset

0:00:08.053 --> 0:00:10.099
<i>I had to ensure its delivery.</i>

0:00:11.011 --> 0:00:12.090
He's not a local warlord.

0:00:12.099 --> 0:00:14.003
He's Imperial.

0:00:14.070 --> 0:00:15.070
I'm in.

0:00:15.078 --> 0:00:20.004
<i>Our secrecy is our survival.

0:00:21.054 --> 0:00:23.046
<i>Our strength was once in our numbers.</i>

0:00:23.054 --> 0:00:25.004
Now, we live in the shadows.

0:00:26.013 --> 0:00:28.050
Our world was shattered by the Empire.

0:00:33.026 --> 0:00:35.059
You're going

0:00:35.068 --> 0:00:36.089
This is the Way.

0:00:36.097 --> 0:00:40.064
In the wake of your destruction

0:00:40.077 --> 0:00:42.056
Is it still a hunter?

0:00:42.064 --> 0:00:44.081
No. But it will protect.

0:00:44.089 --> 0:00:47.023
You got a real thing for droids

0:00:47.077 --> 0:00:49.061
I got a real thing for that droid.

0:00:49.069 --> 0:00:51.015
Let me take the child to him...

0:00:51.023 --> 0:00:52.078
Let's kill him and get out of here.

0:00:52.086 --> 0:00:55.053
- We both need the client to be eliminated.

0:00:55.061 --> 0:00:58.001
As long as the Imp lives

0:00:58.003 --> 0:00:59.003
<i>It's a trap.</i>

0:00:59.012 --> 0:01:01.083
<i>- Have they brought the child?</i>

0:01:05.058 --> 0:01:07.063
<i>You have something I want.</i>

0:01:07.096 --> 0:01:09.067
Kuiil? Are you there?

0:01:11.071 --> 0:01:12.084
In a few moments...

0:01:14.030 --> 0:01:15.088
<i>Kuiil! Are you there?</i>

0:01:16.080 --> 0:01:18.097
It will be mine.

0:02:23.066 --> 0:02:26.062
Speeder bikes have arrived

0:02:26.075 --> 0:02:28.092
Awaiting confirmation.

0:02:29.033 --> 0:02:30.033
Knock it off!

0:02:32.038 --> 0:02:35.000
Waiting for confirmation

0:02:35.009 --> 0:02:37.067
<i>That's a go to proceed

0:02:37.076 --> 0:02:41.080
<i>The Moff just touched down and already

0:02:43.089 --> 0:02:45.018
Standing by.

0:02:47.060 --> 0:02:50.065
Did he just say

0:02:50.073 --> 0:02:52.090
Oh, who knows?

0:02:52.098 --> 0:02:56.032
These guys like to lay down the law

0:02:56.040 --> 0:02:58.024
You know how it is.

0:02:58.078 --> 0:03:01.087
I said, shut up. Yeesh.

0:03:02.045 --> 0:03:03.091
What is that thing, anyway?

0:03:03.099 --> 0:03:04.099
Uh, I don't know.

0:03:05.008 --> 0:03:07.075
Maybe Moff wants to eat it.

0:03:10.000 --> 0:03:11.000
Can I see it?

0:03:11.083 --> 0:03:13.084
Did you not just hear

0:03:13.092 --> 0:03:15.084
a dozen of his own troopers

0:03:15.092 --> 0:03:17.092
- Okay.

0:03:18.046 --> 0:03:19.097
- Do you get the point?

0:03:20.005 --> 0:03:21.005
Okay.

0:03:47.058 --> 0:03:49.037
Should we offer

0:03:49.045 --> 0:03:50.083
You just wanna look at it.

0:03:50.091 --> 0:03:52.029
So what?

0:03:52.037 --> 0:03:53.037
Barely.

0:03:53.046 --> 0:03:56.050
I mean, I grabbed it up off the ground

0:03:57.009 --> 0:03:58.059
It's more than I got to see it.

0:03:58.067 --> 0:04:01.080
Look, I'm not taking it out of

0:04:02.018 --> 0:04:04.072
- Fine.

0:04:09.064 --> 0:04:12.023
Let me check on this thing. This is crazy.

0:04:12.031 --> 0:04:13.035
Any update yet?

0:04:13.044 --> 0:04:16.019
<i>That's a negative.

0:04:16.027 --> 0:04:18.008
<i>He just killed an officer

0:04:18.011 --> 0:04:20.011
<i>- so this might take a while.</i>

0:04:20.019 --> 0:04:21.082
Thank you.

0:04:21.090 --> 0:04:24.045
Standing by still. Unbelievable.

0:04:26.003 --> 0:04:28.058
Hey, how long has it been

0:04:28.066 --> 0:04:31.004
I don't know

0:04:31.083 --> 0:04:33.087
Uh, it's been

0:04:33.096 --> 0:04:34.096
Oh, my God.

0:04:35.004 --> 0:04:37.009
Shouldn't we check

0:04:37.017 --> 0:04:38.046
You hit it pretty hard.

0:04:38.055 --> 0:04:39.084
You just wanna see it.

0:04:39.092 --> 0:04:41.063
We should check

0:04:41.071 --> 0:04:43.076
The last thing that you want

0:04:43.084 --> 0:04:45.080
and have him open it

0:04:45.089 --> 0:04:47.055
Okay. Okay, look.

0:04:47.064 --> 0:04:50.047
Take a peek. Everything's fine.

0:04:50.056 --> 0:04:51.056
What is that?

0:04:51.085 --> 0:04:53.060
I don't know.

0:04:53.069 --> 0:04:55.014
A pet? I thought you...

0:04:58.040 --> 0:05:00.028
Serves you right.

0:05:01.032 --> 0:05:02.074
Stop that.

0:05:03.036 --> 0:05:04.070
Identify yourself!

0:05:04.090 --> 0:05:06.024
I am IG-11.

0:05:06.032 --> 0:05:10.049
I am this child's nurse droid and require

0:05:10.058 --> 0:05:11.091
A nurse droid?

0:05:12.000 --> 0:05:14.079
I thought it was a hunter.

0:05:14.087 --> 0:05:17.021
Yeah, well

0:05:18.038 --> 0:05:21.030
I'm sorry, nurse

0:05:22.026 --> 0:05:23.092
Are you refusing my request?

0:05:24.001 --> 0:05:25.030
No.

0:05:25.043 --> 0:05:26.097
I'm telling you to get out of here.

0:05:32.047 --> 0:05:34.056
Hey.

0:05:45.007 --> 0:05:46.036
That was unpleasant.

0:05:46.045 --> 0:05:47.086
I'm sorry you had to see that.

0:06:16.060 --> 0:06:17.073
Is there another way out?

0:06:17.081 --> 0:06:19.019
No, that's it.

0:06:21.002 --> 0:06:23.027
- What about the sewers?

0:06:23.036 --> 0:06:25.074
The Mandalorians

0:06:25.082 --> 0:06:28.007
If we can get down there

0:06:28.015 --> 0:06:29.057
Yeah, sewers are good.

0:06:29.066 --> 0:06:31.032
Checking for access points.

0:06:34.049 --> 0:06:36.037
What the hell are they waiting for?

0:06:49.068 --> 0:06:50.068
Hold up.

0:06:57.098 --> 0:06:59.027
They're setting up an E-Web.

0:07:01.010 --> 0:07:02.011
It's over.

0:07:05.048 --> 0:07:06.090
I found the sewer vent.

0:07:06.099 --> 0:07:08.049
Let's get the hell out of here.

0:07:30.017 --> 0:07:32.030
It's assembled!

0:07:32.039 --> 0:07:35.018
- Blow it.

0:07:35.026 --> 0:07:36.026
Get out of the way!

0:07:45.082 --> 0:07:50.036
Your astute panic suggests

0:07:50.070 --> 0:07:54.024
I would prefer to avoid

0:07:54.032 --> 0:07:57.041
and encourage a moment of consideration.

0:07:58.016 --> 0:08:01.079
Members of my escort

0:08:01.087 --> 0:08:04.071
of an E-Web heavy repeating blaster.

0:08:06.009 --> 0:08:07.080
If you are unfamiliar with this weapon

0:08:07.092 --> 0:08:11.093
I am sure that Republican Shock Trooper

0:08:12.001 --> 0:08:17.035
will advise you that she has witnessed

0:08:17.043 --> 0:08:21.002
facing the predecessor

0:08:23.052 --> 0:08:28.053
Or perhaps the decommissioned

0:08:29.023 --> 0:08:33.007
has heard the songs

0:08:33.015 --> 0:08:36.020
when gunships outfitted

0:08:36.028 --> 0:08:42.037
laid waste to fields of Mandalorian

0:08:44.012 --> 0:08:50.059
I advise disgraced Magistrate Greef Karga

0:08:51.009 --> 0:08:56.047
and urge you to lay down your arms

0:08:56.059 --> 0:09:00.001
The structure you are trapped in

0:09:00.010 --> 0:09:04.044
and your storied lives will come

0:09:07.065 --> 0:09:09.015
What do you propose?

0:09:10.032 --> 0:09:12.019
Reasonable negotiation.

0:09:14.011 --> 0:09:15.074
What assurance do you offer?

0:09:15.082 --> 0:09:19.045
If you're asking

0:09:20.066 --> 0:09:23.050
Just as you betrayed

0:09:23.058 --> 0:09:27.058
I would gladly break any promise

0:09:28.013 --> 0:09:32.026
The assurance I give is this:

0:09:32.034 --> 0:09:36.051
which at this time involves

0:09:40.022 --> 0:09:45.023
I will give you until nightfall, and then

0:09:52.053 --> 0:09:54.053
I say we hear him out.

0:09:54.065 --> 0:09:56.040
The minute we open that door, we're dead.

0:09:56.049 --> 0:09:57.091
We're dead if we don't.

0:09:58.016 --> 0:09:59.095
At least out there, we've got a shot.

0:10:00.003 --> 0:10:01.047
That's easy for you to say.

0:10:01.049 --> 0:10:03.012
I'm a Rebel Shock Trooper.

0:10:03.020 --> 0:10:04.095
They'll upload me to a Mind Flayer.

0:10:05.004 --> 0:10:07.083
Those aren't real.

0:10:07.092 --> 0:10:10.042
I don't care to find out.

0:10:11.092 --> 0:10:13.067
What about you, Mando?

0:10:13.076 --> 0:10:15.001
I know who he is.

0:10:17.059 --> 0:10:18.076
It's Moff Gideon.

0:10:18.084 --> 0:10:19.089
No.

0:10:19.097 --> 0:10:22.018
Moff Gideon was executed for war crimes.

0:10:22.026 --> 0:10:24.068
It's him.

0:10:24.077 --> 0:10:26.014
So? What does that prove?

0:10:26.023 --> 0:10:28.073
I haven't heard that name

0:10:29.023 --> 0:10:30.027
On Mandalore?

0:10:30.036 --> 0:10:32.036
I was not born on Mandalore.

0:10:32.044 --> 0:10:33.053
But you're a Mandalorian.

0:10:33.090 --> 0:10:35.044
Mandalorian isn't a race.

0:10:37.007 --> 0:10:38.057
It's a Creed.

0:14:00.098 --> 0:14:02.044
I was a foundling.

0:14:02.053 --> 0:14:04.024
They raised me in the Fighting Corps.

0:14:04.065 --> 0:14:06.040
I was treated as one of their own.

0:14:06.061 --> 0:14:09.037
When I came of age

0:14:09.053 --> 0:14:12.095
The only record of my family name

0:14:13.004 --> 0:14:16.062
Moff Gideon was an ISB Officer

0:14:17.046 --> 0:14:19.008
That's how I know it's him.

0:14:19.021 --> 0:14:20.096
That's how he knows who we all are.

0:14:21.004 --> 0:14:24.030
He says he needs us

0:14:24.038 --> 0:14:26.047
I was worried when the Ugnaught

0:14:26.055 --> 0:14:29.064
but if they'd captured the kid

0:14:30.009 --> 0:14:31.010
Hail them again.

0:14:34.089 --> 0:14:36.006
Come in, Kuiil.

0:14:36.098 --> 0:14:38.002
Kuiil?

0:14:38.081 --> 0:14:40.094
- Nothing.

0:14:46.086 --> 0:14:48.066
Kuiil has been terminated.

0:14:49.095 --> 0:14:51.020
What did you do?

0:14:51.028 --> 0:14:53.020
<i>I am fulfilling my base function.</i>

0:14:53.028 --> 0:14:54.037
Which is?

0:14:54.049 --> 0:14:56.016
To nurse and protect.

0:15:03.092 --> 0:15:04.092
What was that?

0:15:05.000 --> 0:15:06.001
Look alive.

0:15:46.084 --> 0:15:47.084
Look!

0:16:14.041 --> 0:16:15.041
Cover me.

0:18:37.026 --> 0:18:38.043
Burn them out.

0:18:41.055 --> 0:18:45.014
Stay with me, buddy.

0:18:45.023 --> 0:18:47.010
This is our only path out.

0:18:50.027 --> 0:18:51.052
Stay with me.

0:18:51.094 --> 0:18:55.015
If you go near this child

0:18:55.024 --> 0:18:58.032
I understand.

0:18:58.040 --> 0:18:59.057
Yes, of course.

0:19:02.078 --> 0:19:04.079
Oh, I love IG units.

0:19:05.066 --> 0:19:07.033
I'm not gonna make it. Go.

0:19:07.041 --> 0:19:11.017
Shut up. You just got your bell rung.

0:19:11.025 --> 0:19:12.034
Leave me.

0:19:16.038 --> 0:19:20.034
- I'm gonna need to take this thing off.

0:19:20.055 --> 0:19:22.097
You make sure the child is safe.

0:19:24.010 --> 0:19:25.010
Here.

0:19:27.089 --> 0:19:31.006
When you get to the Mandalorian covert

0:19:31.019 --> 0:19:34.048
You tell them it's from Din Djarin.

0:19:34.057 --> 0:19:38.024
You tell them the foundling was

0:19:38.032 --> 0:19:40.007
We can make it.

0:19:48.058 --> 0:19:50.012
Come on! Let's go!

0:19:50.021 --> 0:19:52.041
I'm not gonna make it and you know it.

0:20:10.044 --> 0:20:12.035
You protect the child.

0:20:12.044 --> 0:20:15.027
I can hold them back long enough

0:20:15.036 --> 0:20:17.019
Let me have a warrior's death.

0:20:17.028 --> 0:20:18.099
I won't leave you.

0:20:19.090 --> 0:20:21.049
This is the Way.

0:21:19.067 --> 0:21:21.038
Come on! It's open, let's go!

0:21:23.009 --> 0:21:25.084
Go. Go.

0:21:26.022 --> 0:21:28.018
We have to move! Now!

0:21:30.047 --> 0:21:31.064
Go.

0:21:33.048 --> 0:21:35.027
Escape and protect this child.

0:21:35.035 --> 0:21:37.027
I will stay with the Mandalorian.

0:21:41.028 --> 0:21:42.053
Promise me you'll bring him.

0:21:42.061 --> 0:21:43.099
You have my word.

0:22:00.004 --> 0:22:01.055
Do it.

0:22:02.001 --> 0:22:03.001
Do what?

0:22:03.046 --> 0:22:05.001
Just get it over with.

0:22:06.013 --> 0:22:08.097
I'd rather you kill me than some Imp.

0:22:09.022 --> 0:22:11.047
I told you.

0:22:11.056 --> 0:22:13.022
I am a nurse droid.

0:22:14.006 --> 0:22:16.069
IGs are all hunters.

0:22:16.098 --> 0:22:19.098
Not this one. I was reprogrammed.

0:22:20.006 --> 0:22:22.090
I need to remove your helmet

0:22:26.061 --> 0:22:29.012
Try it and I'll kill you.

0:22:31.083 --> 0:22:34.045
It is forbidden.

0:22:34.062 --> 0:22:39.033
No living thing has seen me

0:22:41.034 --> 0:22:42.096
I am not a living thing.

0:22:52.089 --> 0:22:56.094
This is a bacta spray.

0:22:57.081 --> 0:23:00.081
You have suffered damage

0:23:02.073 --> 0:23:04.023
You mean my brain?

0:23:04.082 --> 0:23:07.086
That was a joke.

0:23:34.051 --> 0:23:36.010
I got you.

0:23:52.016 --> 0:23:53.049
Do you know which way to go?

0:23:53.058 --> 0:23:55.058
No. I don't know these tunnels.

0:23:55.066 --> 0:23:57.037
I've only entered from the bazaar.

0:24:01.012 --> 0:24:03.075
Well, if we get the smell

0:24:03.084 --> 0:24:06.050
it'll lead us up to the plains

0:24:06.059 --> 0:24:09.022
And the Imps will

0:24:09.030 --> 0:24:12.026
We need the Mandalorians

0:24:17.093 --> 0:24:20.069
Ugh, this place is a maze.

0:24:20.077 --> 0:24:21.077
Stop.

0:24:23.056 --> 0:24:24.077
I can stand.

0:24:24.086 --> 0:24:26.082
The bacta infusion is working.

0:24:26.090 --> 0:24:28.057
I'll try to find tracks.

0:24:30.049 --> 0:24:31.049
We're close.

0:24:34.070 --> 0:24:35.078
Turn here.

0:25:30.000 --> 0:25:31.051
We should go.

0:25:31.059 --> 0:25:35.068
You go. Take the ship.

0:25:35.076 --> 0:25:36.097
Did you know about this?

0:25:37.043 --> 0:25:39.043
Is this the work of your bounty hunters?

0:25:39.051 --> 0:25:40.052
No.

0:25:40.060 --> 0:25:43.031
When you left the system

0:25:43.039 --> 0:25:45.027
and the hunters just melted away.

0:25:45.035 --> 0:25:47.023
You know how it is.

0:25:47.031 --> 0:25:49.027
They're mercenaries. They're not zealots.

0:25:49.036 --> 0:25:51.094
Did you do this? Did you?

0:25:52.003 --> 0:25:54.011
- No!

0:25:56.061 --> 0:25:58.032
We revealed ourselves.

0:25:59.037 --> 0:26:02.070
We knew what could happen

0:26:04.037 --> 0:26:07.025
The Imperials arrived shortly thereafter.

0:26:08.084 --> 0:26:11.038
This is what resulted.

0:26:12.046 --> 0:26:14.017
Did any survive?

0:26:14.034 --> 0:26:18.005
I hope so.

0:26:21.047 --> 0:26:22.056
Come with us.

0:26:23.031 --> 0:26:24.073
No.

0:26:24.081 --> 0:26:29.006
I will not abandon this place

0:27:02.010 --> 0:27:06.006
Show me the one

0:27:08.039 --> 0:27:10.006
This is the one.

0:27:10.031 --> 0:27:13.048
This is the one that you hunted

0:27:13.057 --> 0:27:16.069
Yes. The one that saved me as well.

0:27:17.078 --> 0:27:20.020
- From the mudhorn?

0:27:21.032 --> 0:27:22.070
It looks helpless.

0:27:24.079 --> 0:27:27.029
It's injured, but it is not helpless.

0:27:27.037 --> 0:27:29.058
Its species can move objects

0:27:30.008 --> 0:27:31.088
I know of such things.

0:27:33.063 --> 0:27:38.084
The songs of eons past tell of battles

0:27:38.093 --> 0:27:43.030
and an order of sorcerers called Jedi

0:27:43.085 --> 0:27:45.001
It is an enemy?

0:27:45.047 --> 0:27:49.060
No. Its kind were enemies

0:27:50.094 --> 0:27:52.015
What is it?

0:27:52.065 --> 0:27:54.065
It is a foundling.

0:27:56.036 --> 0:27:59.024
By Creed, it is in your care.

0:28:01.066 --> 0:28:03.045
You wish me to train this thing?

0:28:03.053 --> 0:28:05.070
It is too weak. It would die.

0:28:05.079 --> 0:28:09.037
You have no choice.

0:28:10.016 --> 0:28:11.017
Where?

0:28:11.025 --> 0:28:12.096
This, you must determine.

0:28:14.017 --> 0:28:15.096
You expect me to search the galaxy

0:28:16.005 --> 0:28:17.019
for the home of this creature

0:28:17.021 --> 0:28:19.072
and deliver it to a race

0:28:21.080 --> 0:28:22.089
This is the Way.

0:28:28.027 --> 0:28:29.027
Hey.

0:28:29.073 --> 0:28:32.048
These tunnels will be lousy with Imps

0:28:32.069 --> 0:28:34.098
We should at least discuss an escape plan.

0:28:35.052 --> 0:28:37.011
If you follow

0:28:37.019 --> 0:28:39.019
it will lead you to the underground river.

0:28:39.028 --> 0:28:41.040
It flows downstream toward the lava flats.

0:28:42.095 --> 0:28:44.037
I think we should go.

0:28:44.045 --> 0:28:45.062
I'm staying.

0:28:45.078 --> 0:28:47.070
I need to help her and I need to heal.

0:28:47.079 --> 0:28:48.087
You must go.

0:28:48.095 --> 0:28:51.058
A foundling is in your care.

0:28:51.066 --> 0:28:57.000
By Creed, until it is of age or reunited

0:28:57.009 --> 0:28:58.080
you are as its father.

0:29:04.084 --> 0:29:06.014
This is the Way.

0:29:08.097 --> 0:29:10.052
You have earned your Signet.

0:29:25.078 --> 0:29:27.020
You are a clan of two.

0:29:31.004 --> 0:29:32.041
Thank you.

0:29:32.050 --> 0:29:34.012
I will wear this with honor.

0:29:44.026 --> 0:29:45.026
We should go.

0:29:45.034 --> 0:29:47.080
IG, please guard

0:29:47.089 --> 0:29:49.072
A scouting party draws near.

0:29:51.056 --> 0:29:54.027
Hang on.

0:29:56.090 --> 0:29:59.011
I have one more gift

0:29:59.082 --> 0:30:02.049
Have you trained in the Rising Phoenix?

0:30:02.057 --> 0:30:04.036
When I was a boy. Yes.

0:30:04.045 --> 0:30:08.024
Then this will make you complete.

0:30:10.024 --> 0:30:11.037
Thank you.

0:30:11.045 --> 0:30:14.000
ARMORER When you have healed

0:30:14.008 --> 0:30:16.054
Until you know it

0:30:16.062 --> 0:30:17.092
I understand.

0:30:22.042 --> 0:30:23.084
WEBVTT

0:30:30.051 --> 0:30:31.060
You are protected.

0:30:33.031 --> 0:30:34.068
More will come. You must go.

0:30:35.010 --> 0:30:36.019
Come with us.

0:30:36.060 --> 0:30:38.031
My place is here.

0:30:38.044 --> 0:30:39.061
Restock your munitions.

0:30:42.007 --> 0:30:47.024
IG, carry this for Din Djarin

0:30:48.070 --> 0:30:49.091
Now, go.

0:30:49.099 --> 0:30:51.099
Down to the river and across the plains.

0:30:54.020 --> 0:30:55.050
Be safe on your journey.

0:30:55.058 --> 0:30:56.058
Thank you.

0:31:27.015 --> 0:31:28.015
Hey, Mando.

0:31:29.082 --> 0:31:30.082
Where are they?

0:31:33.037 --> 0:31:34.079
I said, where are they?

0:32:05.069 --> 0:32:07.015
This is the lava river.

0:32:13.078 --> 0:32:15.041
The ferry droid is fried.

0:32:15.049 --> 0:32:18.071
Yeah, but if we push the boat out

0:32:18.079 --> 0:32:19.079
Come on.

0:32:19.087 --> 0:32:21.062
Looks old. Will it take the heat?

0:32:21.071 --> 0:32:23.029
You got a better idea?

0:32:23.079 --> 0:32:24.079
Guess not.

0:32:28.084 --> 0:32:29.084
Push!

0:32:32.018 --> 0:32:33.055
Come on! What're you doing?

0:32:33.064 --> 0:32:35.076
- Let's try this.

0:32:39.027 --> 0:32:41.006
You guys mind getting out of the way?

0:32:41.035 --> 0:32:42.035
Oh!

0:32:47.086 --> 0:32:48.086
Good job.

0:32:51.091 --> 0:32:54.070
Watch your feet. It's molten lava.

0:32:54.078 --> 0:32:56.003
No kidding.

0:33:15.005 --> 0:33:17.056
I don't suppose anybody here speaks droid?

0:33:18.035 --> 0:33:20.081
I believe he is asking

0:33:22.002 --> 0:33:25.023
Down river. To the lava flat.

0:33:53.068 --> 0:33:55.034
That's it. We're free!

0:34:01.006 --> 0:34:02.018
No.

0:34:02.064 --> 0:34:03.077
No, we're not.

0:34:03.085 --> 0:34:07.011
Stormtroopers.

0:34:07.023 --> 0:34:10.019
It looks like an entire platoon.

0:34:10.028 --> 0:34:11.065
Stop the boat.

0:34:12.007 --> 0:34:14.065
Hey, Droid, I said stop the boat.

0:34:16.057 --> 0:34:18.058
Hey! I'm talking to you.

0:34:18.066 --> 0:34:19.099
I said stop!

0:34:26.017 --> 0:34:27.071
We're still moving.

0:34:28.059 --> 0:34:29.075
Looks like we fight.

0:34:29.084 --> 0:34:32.013
- There are too many.

0:34:32.021 --> 0:34:33.051
'Cause I can't surrender.

0:34:33.059 --> 0:34:36.026
They will not be satisfied

0:34:36.034 --> 0:34:37.089
This is unacceptable.

0:34:37.097 --> 0:34:40.056
I will eliminate the enemy

0:34:40.064 --> 0:34:42.081
You don't have

0:34:42.089 --> 0:34:44.048
You wouldn't even get to daylight.

0:34:44.056 --> 0:34:45.081
That is not my objective.

0:34:46.023 --> 0:34:48.098
We're getting close. Saddle up.

0:34:50.069 --> 0:34:53.094
I still have the security protocols

0:34:54.003 --> 0:34:57.020
If my designs are compromised

0:34:57.028 --> 0:34:58.082
What're you talking about?

0:34:58.091 --> 0:35:01.041
I am not permitted to be captured.

0:35:01.053 --> 0:35:03.083
Are we gonna keep talking

0:35:04.062 --> 0:35:06.037
I can no longer carry this for you.

0:35:08.071 --> 0:35:10.004
Nor can I watch over the child.

0:35:10.067 --> 0:35:13.005
Wait. You can't self-destruct.

0:35:13.013 --> 0:35:14.092
Your base command is to watch the child.

0:35:15.001 --> 0:35:17.034
That supersedes

0:35:18.038 --> 0:35:19.097
- Right?

0:35:20.005 --> 0:35:22.068
Good. Now, grab a blaster

0:35:22.076 --> 0:35:24.047
Victory through combat

0:35:24.056 --> 0:35:27.031
We will be captured.

0:35:27.039 --> 0:35:31.019
Sadly, there is no scenario where

0:35:32.027 --> 0:35:34.007
Listen, you're not going anywhere.

0:35:34.015 --> 0:35:35.075
We need you. Let's just come up with a...

0:35:35.078 --> 0:35:38.032
Please tell me the child

0:35:38.040 --> 0:35:41.024
If you do so

0:35:41.087 --> 0:35:43.037
But you'll be destroyed.

0:35:43.062 --> 0:35:47.021
And you will live

0:35:48.041 --> 0:35:50.038
No. We need you.

0:35:50.046 --> 0:35:53.034
There is nothing to be sad about.

0:35:53.075 --> 0:35:55.055
I'm not sad.

0:35:55.071 --> 0:35:59.055
Yes, you are. I'm a nurse droid.

0:36:07.018 --> 0:36:08.018
IG?

0:36:10.040 --> 0:36:11.094
What're you doing?

0:36:43.064 --> 0:36:47.006
Manufacturer's protocol dictates

0:36:49.010 --> 0:36:50.044
I must be destroyed.

0:37:25.064 --> 0:37:26.076
Moff Gideon!

0:37:41.036 --> 0:37:43.032
- He missed!

0:37:43.040 --> 0:37:45.028
Our blasters are useless against him.

0:37:45.037 --> 0:37:47.028
Let's make the baby do

0:37:47.041 --> 0:37:49.049
Come on, baby! Do the magic hand thing.

0:37:53.067 --> 0:37:55.071
- I'm out of ideas.

0:37:55.079 --> 0:37:57.025
Here he comes!

0:39:17.021 --> 0:39:18.021
No!

0:39:40.015 --> 0:39:43.065
That was impressive, Mando.

0:39:45.007 --> 0:39:47.036
It looks like your Guild rates

0:39:48.040 --> 0:39:49.086
Any more stormtroopers?

0:39:49.095 --> 0:39:51.053
I think we cleaned up the town.

0:39:52.078 --> 0:39:54.083
I'm thinking of staying around

0:39:57.058 --> 0:40:00.004
- You're staying here?

0:40:00.012 --> 0:40:02.046
Nevarro is a very fine planet.

0:40:02.054 --> 0:40:05.063
And now that the scum and villainy

0:40:05.071 --> 0:40:07.042
it's very respectable again.

0:40:07.051 --> 0:40:09.030
As a bounty hunter hive?

0:40:10.039 --> 0:40:13.056
Some of my favorite people

0:40:13.064 --> 0:40:18.089
And perhaps, this specimen of soldier

0:40:18.098 --> 0:40:22.048
Yeah. I've got some clerical

0:40:22.056 --> 0:40:24.065
And if you would agree

0:40:24.073 --> 0:40:28.003
clerical concerns would be

0:40:28.011 --> 0:40:33.049
But you, my friend, you will be welcome

0:40:33.058 --> 0:40:35.087
So, go off, enjoy yourself.

0:40:36.066 --> 0:40:40.075
And when you're ready to return

0:40:47.067 --> 0:40:50.026
I'm afraid I have

0:40:56.076 --> 0:40:58.052
Take care of this little one.

0:41:01.031 --> 0:41:04.077
Or maybe, it'll take care of you.

0:42:03.058 --> 0:42:05.000
What do you got there?

0:42:18.076 --> 0:42:20.027
I didn't think I'd see this again.

0:42:25.090 --> 0:42:27.098
Why don't you hang onto that?
