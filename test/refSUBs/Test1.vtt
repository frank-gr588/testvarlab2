0:00:21.108 --> 0:00:23.806
Sorry guys, I just wanted to upload a subtitle in order to upgrade my allowed daily downloads.
Now I am not a sub leecher <3
Sorry again and have a nice day :)

0:00:23.936 --> 0:00:25.242
Can I gave you a hand?

0:00:25.373 --> 0:00:27.114
If I needed a hand,
I'd ask for it...

0:00:27.244 --> 0:00:29.072
Thank you very much.

0:00:52.139 --> 0:00:53.227
There you go, miss.Thanks.

0:00:56.012 --> 0:00:58.275
Marion.
How's it going?

0:00:58.406 --> 0:01:00.886
Eh. Could be worse.
Brain's still working.

0:01:01.017 --> 0:01:03.367
Is it a pastrami day?

0:01:03.498 --> 0:01:06.327
Yeah. Uh, one
and a quarter pounds. You got it.

0:01:06.457 --> 0:01:09.112
Not a pound and a half,
you overshot last time.

0:01:09.243 --> 0:01:12.028
Oh.
Sorry 'bout that.

0:01:12.159 --> 0:01:14.291
What do we have here?

0:01:14.422 --> 0:01:17.555
Extra-sharp Wisconsin cheddar.

0:01:17.686 --> 0:01:19.905
"Extra-sharp," hmm?

0:01:23.648 --> 0:01:25.955
Ohh.

0:01:26.086 --> 0:01:28.958
You can keep it, Wisconsin.
Ugh.

0:01:56.290 --> 0:01:58.901
It wasn't like this
when I came before.

0:02:12.044 --> 0:02:13.524
Need some help?

0:02:13.655 --> 0:02:15.613
I'm fine!

0:02:20.314 --> 0:02:22.403
Are you sure
you don't want a push?

0:02:22.533 --> 0:02:24.361
I'm sure.

0:02:29.018 --> 0:02:31.194
What happened to poor Nippy?

0:02:31.325 --> 0:02:35.198
Ah. It was my fault.

0:02:35.329 --> 0:02:37.244
I was driving
with the windows open,

0:02:37.374 --> 0:02:39.333
you know, before all this hit.

0:02:39.463 --> 0:02:41.180
And... I don't know...
Something got into him.

0:02:41.204 --> 0:02:43.250
He saw a cat or something...
But he jumped.

0:02:43.380 --> 0:02:44.599
Oh, no.

0:02:44.729 --> 0:02:45.904
I pulled right over,

0:02:46.035 --> 0:02:47.906
screaming my head off,
"Nippyyyy!"

0:02:48.037 --> 0:02:50.387
Ohh.But... he was gone.

0:02:50.518 --> 0:02:52.433
Oh, that's terrible.

0:02:52.563 --> 0:02:55.044
I hope you find him.

0:02:55.175 --> 0:02:56.350
If you could keep an eye out.

0:02:56.480 --> 0:02:57.829
Yeah, I will.
Sure.

0:02:57.960 --> 0:03:00.615
I-I live right over here
on... on Clementine.

0:03:00.745 --> 0:03:02.225
This is my route.

0:03:02.356 --> 0:03:05.446
When I can get this thing going.

0:03:07.578 --> 0:03:09.972
Maybe just a little push.

0:03:12.061 --> 0:03:13.802
Well, if you're sure
you don't mind.

0:03:13.932 --> 0:03:15.499
Nah.
I'm happy to help.

0:03:26.989 --> 0:03:28.208
Okay.
Throw it in neutral.

0:03:28.338 --> 0:03:31.428
And one, two, three.

0:03:35.084 --> 0:03:35.867
There you go.

0:03:35.998 --> 0:03:38.087
Oh, sorry for the trouble.

0:03:38.218 --> 0:03:40.437
Put it back in drive.
Not at all.

0:03:40.568 --> 0:03:43.266
Have a nice day. Yeah, you too.

0:03:43.397 --> 0:03:44.963
Hope you find Nippy.

0:03:45.094 --> 0:03:47.227
Thank you.

0:03:49.925 --> 0:03:52.841
Ohh.
What in the world?

0:04:03.155 --> 0:04:04.635
How ya doing, Marion?

0:04:04.766 --> 0:04:06.246
Great. Ah, good.

0:04:06.376 --> 0:04:08.335
Are you okay? Oh, yeah.

0:05:24.236 --> 0:05:25.716
Okay, okay, okay.

0:05:25.847 --> 0:05:28.545
Actually,
it's my favorite meal to cook.

0:05:28.676 --> 0:05:31.853
Hmm. I like it. And I think
my secret is...

0:05:31.983 --> 0:05:33.289
Ma?

0:05:33.420 --> 0:05:35.552
In the kitchen, Jeffie!

0:05:35.683 --> 0:05:36.988
I have a little trick.

0:05:37.119 --> 0:05:38.773
I bet it's the same
we do in my family.

0:05:38.903 --> 0:05:40.340
An egg.
I knew it.

0:05:40.470 --> 0:05:42.080
And you really work it in.

0:05:42.211 --> 0:05:43.821
I mean, you got to use
your hands.

0:05:43.952 --> 0:05:45.475
You are speaking my language.

0:05:45.606 --> 0:05:49.087
Do you cook? Uh, just a few favorites,
nothing fancy.

0:05:49.218 --> 0:05:51.394
Yeah, simple's best.
I mean, why fuss?

0:05:51.525 --> 0:05:55.746
Oh. Jeffie, this is Mr. Takavic.

0:05:55.877 --> 0:05:58.749
Oh, please,
Mr. Takavic was my father.

0:05:58.880 --> 0:06:01.752
Call me "Gene."

0:06:01.883 --> 0:06:04.842
Don't worry, hon,
he's not an ax murderer.

0:06:04.973 --> 0:06:08.063
If he was gonna chop me to bits
he'd have done it already.

0:06:08.193 --> 0:06:10.979
Right, Gene?

0:06:12.894 --> 0:06:17.420
Well, don't just stand there
like a bump on a log, join us.

0:06:19.814 --> 0:06:22.686
Sometimes he gets a little
nervous around new people.

0:06:22.817 --> 0:06:24.732
Ma... Well, you do.

0:06:24.862 --> 0:06:26.037
Now come on.

0:06:26.168 --> 0:06:29.171
Grab a glass and sit down.

0:06:40.225 --> 0:06:41.575
Tell him how we met, Gene.

0:06:41.705 --> 0:06:42.706
Oh, yeah.

0:06:42.837 --> 0:06:44.926
Uh, well,
I was looking for Nippy...

0:06:45.056 --> 0:06:46.056
Yeah.
His dog, poor thing.

0:06:46.144 --> 0:06:47.363
Well, he ran away.

0:06:47.494 --> 0:06:49.365
And Gene here
was putting up posters.

0:06:49.496 --> 0:06:51.336
And your mom was on her way back
from Hansen's.

0:06:51.367 --> 0:06:53.630
And my wheels got stuck
in the snow.

0:06:53.761 --> 0:06:55.391
Well, that was before
the whole thing conked out.

0:06:55.415 --> 0:06:58.330
Yeah, but Gene here
saved the day.

0:06:58.461 --> 0:07:01.899
He even fixed my dumb scooter...
With duct tape!

0:07:02.030 --> 0:07:05.250
Ah.

0:07:05.381 --> 0:07:07.035
To Gene. Come on.

0:07:07.165 --> 0:07:08.732
Yeah.Ahh...

0:07:11.692 --> 0:07:14.608
Mm.

0:07:14.738 --> 0:07:19.569
So your mom tells me
you're a cab driver?

0:07:22.267 --> 0:07:25.880
Have you ever driven
anyone famous?

0:07:26.010 --> 0:07:27.272
Oh, he sure did.

0:07:27.403 --> 0:07:28.665
Tell him, Jeffie.

0:07:33.322 --> 0:07:34.845
Sammy Hagar.

0:07:34.976 --> 0:07:36.717
No!
The Red Rocker?!

0:07:36.847 --> 0:07:37.979
Hey, I love him.

0:07:42.026 --> 0:07:43.026
That's it! Hey!

0:07:44.420 --> 0:07:47.336
What was he like?
Big tipper?

0:07:47.467 --> 0:07:49.730
I guess.

0:07:49.860 --> 0:07:51.732
Mm.Oh. You know what?
You stay comfy.

0:07:51.862 --> 0:07:55.039
I will rescue
this beautiful creation.

0:07:56.171 --> 0:07:57.955
Look at that.

0:08:00.088 --> 0:08:01.350
Ta-da!

0:08:01.481 --> 0:08:03.352
Gene's staying for dinner.

0:08:18.715 --> 0:08:20.369
Dude, what the fuck?!

0:08:20.500 --> 0:08:22.042
I know it's awkward, right?

0:08:22.066 --> 0:08:24.634
But you don't have to
call me "dad." Yet.

0:08:24.765 --> 0:08:27.115
I dunno what this is about...
But all I have to do

0:08:27.245 --> 0:08:29.813
is pick up the phone
and it's bye-bye, Saul Goodman.

0:08:29.944 --> 0:08:32.139
Yeah, but you haven't picked up
the phone yet, have you?

0:08:32.163 --> 0:08:34.165
Or tried to strong-arm me
for cash.

0:08:34.296 --> 0:08:36.559
And guess what?
I know why.

0:08:36.690 --> 0:08:39.910
Because reward money,
blackmail...

0:08:40.041 --> 0:08:41.366
That's not gonna
tickle your pickle.

0:08:41.390 --> 0:08:43.348
I know what you really want.

0:08:43.479 --> 0:08:46.700
Oh, yeah?
What's that?

0:08:46.830 --> 0:08:48.919
You want in the game.

0:08:49.050 --> 0:08:52.662
"The game"?
W-What... What game?

0:08:52.706 --> 0:08:54.446
The game.

0:08:54.577 --> 0:08:56.623
The one you've been watching
your entire life.

0:08:56.753 --> 0:08:59.016
You got your nose pressed up
against the glass,

0:08:59.147 --> 0:09:00.975
peerin' in
while the big boys play.

0:09:01.105 --> 0:09:02.454
Man, speak English.

0:09:02.585 --> 0:09:03.910
What the hell
are you talking about?

0:09:03.934 --> 0:09:05.022
The game.

0:09:05.153 --> 0:09:06.458
It's right there...

0:09:06.589 --> 0:09:10.027
You can see it,
but you can't touch it.

0:09:10.158 --> 0:09:14.858
The cars, the clothes, the cash.

0:09:14.989 --> 0:09:17.469
The ladies.

0:09:17.600 --> 0:09:19.994
It's about knowing
all the angles, you know,

0:09:20.124 --> 0:09:23.345
putting it all on the line
and winning big.

0:09:23.475 --> 0:09:25.826
But here you are, Jeffie.

0:09:25.956 --> 0:09:28.611
Standing outside
with the suckers.

0:09:28.742 --> 0:09:31.396
Tryin' to pay off that cab,
sweatin' the bills,

0:09:31.527 --> 0:09:32.963
gettin' older.

0:09:33.094 --> 0:09:36.924
It's so close, but, damn it,
you just can't get in.

0:09:37.054 --> 0:09:39.143
Until now.

0:09:39.274 --> 0:09:41.319
I can make it happen.

0:09:45.802 --> 0:09:48.152
You?

0:09:48.283 --> 0:09:50.415
Saul Goodman.

0:09:53.331 --> 0:09:54.855
So, here's the deal.

0:09:54.985 --> 0:09:56.639
I will show you the game.

0:09:56.770 --> 0:09:58.772
And then we're done.

0:10:26.190 --> 0:10:27.583
Two days.

0:10:27.627 --> 0:10:29.280
Caller thinks
it's brother-in-law

0:10:29.324 --> 0:10:31.282
with history of violence.

0:10:31.326 --> 0:10:32.544
10-4.

0:10:42.250 --> 0:10:44.208
Noise complaint.
50 or so teens.

0:10:44.252 --> 0:10:45.819
Parents possibly out of town.

0:10:45.862 --> 0:10:47.462
Neighbors say
this is not the first time.

0:10:48.822 --> 0:10:51.128
Man #3:10-20?

0:10:51.172 --> 0:10:53.435
37882 Crestview.

0:10:54.654 --> 0:10:56.960
Headed that way.

0:10:57.004 --> 0:10:59.702
Missing juvenile.
Caucasian male.

0:10:59.746 --> 0:11:02.836
6'2", 240 pounds.

0:11:02.879 --> 0:11:06.448
Last seen at gas station
on Kerrywood and Western.

0:11:24.248 --> 0:11:27.643
Parents called?

0:11:27.687 --> 0:11:30.690
Got ahold of Mom.
ETA is 20 minutes.

0:11:40.612 --> 0:11:42.310
Woman #4:10-23.

0:12:26.310 --> 0:12:27.311
G'night, ladies.

0:12:27.442 --> 0:12:28.791
See ya, Gene.Bye.

0:12:28.922 --> 0:12:30.532
Yeah.

0:14:05.409 --> 0:14:06.584
There a problem?

0:14:06.715 --> 0:14:08.412
No, I...
I just came to say thanks.

0:14:08.543 --> 0:14:09.587
Um, I'm Gene.

0:14:09.718 --> 0:14:11.024
From Cinnabon.

0:14:11.154 --> 0:14:13.113
Uh, you called the EMTs for me

0:14:13.243 --> 0:14:16.420
when I... fainted.

0:14:16.551 --> 0:14:18.292
Yeah.
I remember you.

0:14:18.422 --> 0:14:19.728
"Get a lawyer!"

0:14:19.859 --> 0:14:23.036
Nick!
Do I detect Cinnabons?

0:14:23.166 --> 0:14:24.472
Yeah!

0:14:24.602 --> 0:14:26.648
Well, Christ almighty,
get him in here.

0:14:29.477 --> 0:14:31.958
I'm sorry about
the lawyer thing.

0:14:32.088 --> 0:14:33.655
Just slipped out.

0:14:37.093 --> 0:14:38.660
It's a free country.

0:14:50.628 --> 0:14:53.153
Hi.
Uh, Gene Takavic.

0:14:53.283 --> 0:14:54.589
Uh...

0:14:54.719 --> 0:14:57.418
Hey, Gene. I'm Frank.
This is Nick.

0:14:57.548 --> 0:15:00.638
Yeah. Nick here, um,
did me a solid,

0:15:00.769 --> 0:15:02.336
so, uh...

0:15:02.466 --> 0:15:04.425
Well...

0:15:10.474 --> 0:15:13.738
Please...
Enjoy yourselves.

0:15:13.869 --> 0:15:15.479
Well, God bless ya.

0:15:15.610 --> 0:15:16.741
Well, 9:45.

0:15:16.872 --> 0:15:18.152
Nick, you wanna
grab yours to-go?

0:15:18.265 --> 0:15:20.920
Sure.Yeah.
He's gotta check the lot.

0:15:21.050 --> 0:15:22.922
Yeah.

0:15:23.052 --> 0:15:25.315
Thanks.

0:15:25.446 --> 0:15:27.013
Uh...

0:15:27.143 --> 0:15:28.623
You want to take a load off?

0:15:28.753 --> 0:15:31.756
Grab yourself a cup of coffee
if you'd like.

0:15:31.887 --> 0:15:32.757
Yeah.
Yeah?

0:15:32.888 --> 0:15:35.064
Oh.
Okay.

0:15:35.195 --> 0:15:37.066
Ohh.

0:15:38.589 --> 0:15:42.158
I should not be doing this.

0:15:49.383 --> 0:15:52.125
Hey, do me a favor,

0:15:52.255 --> 0:15:55.345
if you were ever to cross paths
with my wife, shh.

0:15:55.476 --> 0:15:56.564
Oh.

0:15:56.694 --> 0:15:59.393
Scout's honor.

0:15:59.523 --> 0:16:02.439
Ahh.
Oh, man.

0:16:02.570 --> 0:16:06.356
I haven't had one of these
in forever.

0:16:06.487 --> 0:16:08.619
Watching my waistline.

0:16:08.750 --> 0:16:11.405
Yeah, but every now
and then... No harm, right?

0:16:13.929 --> 0:16:16.540
Oh, wow.

0:16:18.107 --> 0:16:19.761
Mmm.

0:16:31.294 --> 0:16:34.776
Mmm.
Mm-mm-mmm-mmm-mmm.

0:16:37.866 --> 0:16:40.042
So, did you catch the game
last night?

0:16:41.783 --> 0:16:43.828
The game?

0:16:43.959 --> 0:16:47.658
What the hell is wrong
with those guys?

0:16:47.789 --> 0:16:49.834
I can't even talk about it.

0:16:49.965 --> 0:16:51.271
Mm.

0:16:51.401 --> 0:16:54.274
Really thought
this was the year.

0:16:54.404 --> 0:16:55.623
Yeah, me too.

0:16:55.753 --> 0:16:57.059
Mm.

0:16:57.190 --> 0:17:00.236
You know,
Texas wasn't even ranked.

0:17:00.367 --> 0:17:02.543
I know.

0:17:02.673 --> 0:17:04.849
Play-calling was crazy.

0:17:04.980 --> 0:17:06.199
The worst.

0:17:06.329 --> 0:17:10.159
Three downs to make
a foot and a half?

0:17:10.290 --> 0:17:12.640
How hard can it be?

0:17:12.770 --> 0:17:16.383
Well, you can't win
when Martinez plays like that.

0:17:16.513 --> 0:17:17.819
Martinez.

0:17:17.949 --> 0:17:20.865
I mean, what's up with him?

0:17:20.996 --> 0:17:23.216
You think something's off?

0:17:23.346 --> 0:17:25.261
Maybe.

0:17:25.392 --> 0:17:27.220
Mm.

0:17:27.350 --> 0:17:29.439
Next week, Oklahoma State.

0:17:29.570 --> 0:17:31.920
The Okies.
Huh?

0:17:32.051 --> 0:17:33.443
Uh, that's what we called them.

0:17:33.574 --> 0:17:37.143
You ever done the drive?
Topeka, Wichita... Nice.

0:17:37.186 --> 0:17:39.058
Well, then you haven't done it.

0:17:39.188 --> 0:17:40.494
Can't beat Memorial.

0:17:40.624 --> 0:17:41.624
Damn straight.

0:17:41.669 --> 0:17:42.539
What do you love most?

0:17:42.670 --> 0:17:44.150
Now, that's a tough one.

0:17:44.280 --> 0:17:45.649
You think Weedon'll come through
on his home turf?

0:17:45.673 --> 0:17:47.066
Yeah.
No way!

0:17:47.196 --> 0:17:48.850
With that thumb? Thumb's a dealbreaker.

0:17:48.980 --> 0:17:51.157
I'll tell you something.

0:17:51.287 --> 0:17:54.595
The Cougar helmet
was the thumb-breaker.

0:17:57.032 --> 0:17:59.034
Mmm.
Mm-mm-mmm.

0:17:59.165 --> 0:18:00.862
Delicious.

0:18:00.992 --> 0:18:02.559
Mmm!

0:18:06.128 --> 0:18:08.739
Welp, I should probably
be heading back.

0:18:08.870 --> 0:18:10.263
Well, thanks again.

0:18:10.393 --> 0:18:11.593
Oh, it's the least I could do.

0:18:11.655 --> 0:18:12.655
Have a good one.

0:18:12.700 --> 0:18:14.354
Come back anytime.

0:19:05.361 --> 0:19:07.711
Have a good night,
Gene. Goodnight, Krista.

0:19:07.842 --> 0:19:09.322
Goodnight.Goodnight.

0:19:49.536 --> 0:19:50.667
Frank?

0:19:50.798 --> 0:19:53.017
Gene, Gene,
the Cinnabon machine.

0:19:53.148 --> 0:19:55.455
I could smell ya
coming up the hallway.

0:19:55.585 --> 0:19:57.239
Oh, I get that all the time.

0:19:57.370 --> 0:19:58.980
Here you go, guys.

0:19:59.110 --> 0:20:00.373
Hey, can I...

0:20:00.503 --> 0:20:02.679
Hey, Gene, don't even ask.
Grab a coffee.

0:20:02.810 --> 0:20:04.464
That was one hell
of a game, huh?

0:20:04.594 --> 0:20:06.030
What were you thinking
at halftime?

0:20:06.161 --> 0:20:08.642
Well, uh, I was thinking,

0:20:08.772 --> 0:20:11.384
"Hey, this could, uh...

0:20:11.514 --> 0:20:13.342
This could be a long one."

0:20:13.473 --> 0:20:15.538
And I tell you, you know who
I'm not bitching about today?

0:20:15.562 --> 0:20:18.260
Pelini. Nah.Pelini. That's...
Yeah, the coach.

0:20:18.391 --> 0:20:19.977
You know me.
I go at him when things are bad,

0:20:20.001 --> 0:20:22.177
but when he does something good,
I'm all about it.

0:20:40.064 --> 0:20:41.588
Goodnight, Gene. Goodnight!

0:21:00.259 --> 0:21:01.738
They got him in there
for a reason.

0:21:01.869 --> 0:21:04.263
Mm-mmm-mmm.
Mmm.

0:21:53.834 --> 0:21:55.488
I still got it.

0:22:07.064 --> 0:22:09.763
Mm-mm-mm-mmm-mmm.

0:22:34.353 --> 0:22:35.615
Can I help you, sir?

0:22:35.745 --> 0:22:36.790
Oh, yeah.

0:22:36.920 --> 0:22:37.965
Uh, no thanks.

0:22:38.095 --> 0:22:39.793
I'm just browsing.

0:22:39.923 --> 0:22:41.577
Okay. Yeah.

0:22:51.674 --> 0:22:56.157
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9...

0:22:59.682 --> 0:23:01.423
14...

0:23:03.556 --> 0:23:07.516
15, 17, 18.

0:23:13.566 --> 0:23:16.395
6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

0:24:00.700 --> 0:24:03.833
2...

0:24:03.964 --> 0:24:06.662
11, 12, 13,

0:24:06.793 --> 0:24:09.317
14, 15.

0:24:09.448 --> 0:24:11.537
Alright. Aaand...

0:24:11.667 --> 0:24:12.842
17 feet.

0:24:12.973 --> 0:24:13.973
Right here.

0:24:23.157 --> 0:24:24.288
Ribbon it off.

0:24:24.419 --> 0:24:25.289
Come on.

0:24:25.420 --> 0:24:27.248
All the way, guys.

0:24:32.427 --> 0:24:33.950
Okay.

0:24:33.994 --> 0:24:36.126
Check, check, one, two.
One, two.

0:24:36.170 --> 0:24:37.780
Alright, let's move.

0:24:37.824 --> 0:24:40.522
Starting position.
Right down there.

0:24:43.482 --> 0:24:45.048
Alright, we ready?

0:24:45.092 --> 0:24:47.224
And grab your bag!

0:24:47.268 --> 0:24:49.313
And go!

0:24:49.357 --> 0:24:51.446
That's it!
Move! Move!

0:24:51.490 --> 0:24:53.274
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go!

0:24:53.317 --> 0:24:55.363
One!
Armani suits and run!

0:24:56.669 --> 0:24:59.280
Two!
Air Jordan shoes for you!

0:25:02.457 --> 0:25:05.286
Three!
Linen shirts for free!

0:25:08.289 --> 0:25:11.814
Four!
Cashmere sweaters out the door!

0:25:11.858 --> 0:25:14.382
Five!
Patagonias to survive!

0:25:16.036 --> 0:25:18.865
Six!
Swanky sweatsuits in the mix!

0:25:18.908 --> 0:25:21.128
Halt!
Ohh. What?

0:25:21.258 --> 0:25:22.259
Too many.

0:25:22.390 --> 0:25:23.696
You gotta be precise.

0:25:23.826 --> 0:25:25.088
Just three of each.

0:25:25.219 --> 0:25:26.699
Why?

0:25:26.829 --> 0:25:28.701
And why do I gotta run
around like an asshole?

0:25:28.831 --> 0:25:29.919
I already told you.

0:25:30.050 --> 0:25:31.225
Three minutes.

0:25:31.355 --> 0:25:32.705
Got it?
That's our window.

0:25:32.835 --> 0:25:35.664
Yeah, but why three minutes?

0:25:35.795 --> 0:25:38.058
Because at three minutes,
that's when security sees you

0:25:38.188 --> 0:25:41.409
on the cameras and the cops haul
your ass to jail, alright?

0:25:41.540 --> 0:25:43.803
So let's go. Wait...
there's cameras?

0:25:43.933 --> 0:25:45.631
Sure, there's cameras!

0:25:45.761 --> 0:25:48.155
They erase the tapes
every 72 hours.

0:25:48.285 --> 0:25:50.287
So that's why you only
take three of each.

0:25:50.418 --> 0:25:52.289
And only the pricey stuff.

0:25:52.420 --> 0:25:53.900
When the store opens
the next morning,

0:25:53.987 --> 0:25:55.554
they won't even know
they were robbed.

0:25:55.684 --> 0:25:58.600
By the time they do inventory,
abracadabra!

0:25:58.731 --> 0:26:00.950
No more Jeffie on the tape,
right?

0:26:01.081 --> 0:26:04.737
So, three items, three minutes.

0:26:04.867 --> 0:26:05.955
It's easy.

0:26:06.086 --> 0:26:08.044
Let's go.

0:26:08.175 --> 0:26:09.176
How many of each?

0:26:09.306 --> 0:26:10.569
Three.

0:26:10.699 --> 0:26:12.962
Pigs get fat,
hogs get slaughtered.

0:26:13.093 --> 0:26:14.355
I dunno...

0:26:16.792 --> 0:26:18.359
What don't you know?

0:26:19.969 --> 0:26:22.189
It's just, this whole thing...
It seems crazy.

0:26:22.319 --> 0:26:23.320
Is this too hot for you?

0:26:23.451 --> 0:26:24.670
You know, just say so.

0:26:24.800 --> 0:26:26.802
You know what?
Screw it.

0:26:26.933 --> 0:26:28.282
"Crazy"?

0:26:28.412 --> 0:26:29.849
I'll tell you what's crazy.

0:26:29.979 --> 0:26:32.112
Fifty-year-old
high school chemistry teacher

0:26:32.242 --> 0:26:33.853
comes into my office.

0:26:33.983 --> 0:26:37.247
The guy is so broke,
he can't pay his own mortgage.

0:26:37.378 --> 0:26:39.249
One year later,
he's got a pile of cash

0:26:39.380 --> 0:26:41.164
as big as a Volkswagen.

0:26:41.295 --> 0:26:43.993
That's crazy.

0:26:44.124 --> 0:26:46.126
I'll do it.

0:26:46.256 --> 0:26:48.563
This sounds good to you?

0:26:50.521 --> 0:26:52.175
I think it'll work.

0:26:52.306 --> 0:26:53.568
Well, look at you.

0:26:53.699 --> 0:26:55.091
You're young.

0:26:55.222 --> 0:26:57.441
You're probably, uh,
fast on the feet, huh?

0:26:57.572 --> 0:26:59.748
Okay, I-I didn't say
I wouldn't do it.

0:26:59.879 --> 0:27:04.405
I just had some questions
about, like, logistics.

0:27:06.059 --> 0:27:07.756
Are you in or out?

0:27:12.935 --> 0:27:13.980
In.

0:27:14.110 --> 0:27:15.851
Okay.

0:27:15.982 --> 0:27:18.549
Back to one.

0:27:18.593 --> 0:27:20.726
Check, test, one, two, one, two.

0:27:20.769 --> 0:27:24.381
Okay, and ready, set, action!

0:27:24.425 --> 0:27:26.645
Move! Move! Move!

0:27:26.688 --> 0:27:28.777
Pick up the pace!
Go! Go! Go!

0:27:28.821 --> 0:27:31.606
One!
Armani suits and run!

0:27:31.650 --> 0:27:33.434
Two!
Air Jordan shoes for you!

0:27:33.477 --> 0:27:36.176
Three!
Linen shirts for free!

0:27:36.219 --> 0:27:38.569
Four!
Cashmere sweaters out the door!

0:27:38.613 --> 0:27:40.920
Five!
Patagonias to survive!

0:27:40.963 --> 0:27:43.270
Six!
Swanky sweatsuits in the mix!

0:27:43.313 --> 0:27:44.445
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go!

0:28:03.551 --> 0:28:05.553
Barbara?
Yes?

0:28:05.684 --> 0:28:08.469
Let's ask maintenance
to give this area a polish.

0:28:08.599 --> 0:28:10.123
Got it, I'll call now.

0:28:10.253 --> 0:28:12.473
Thanks.

0:28:12.603 --> 0:28:14.518
Okay, then.
Have a good night.

0:28:14.649 --> 0:28:15.519
You too.

0:28:15.650 --> 0:28:17.217
Excuse me, ma'am?

0:28:17.347 --> 0:28:19.349
There's a delivery.

0:28:19.480 --> 0:28:21.134
A delivery?

0:28:24.441 --> 0:28:25.921
No.

0:28:26.052 --> 0:28:26.879
No, no.

0:28:27.009 --> 0:28:29.403
Stop.

0:28:29.533 --> 0:28:31.579
You are not leaving that thing
on my loading dock.

0:28:31.710 --> 0:28:32.972
No way.

0:28:34.930 --> 0:28:38.325
Fourteen twelve
Cottonwood Drive...

0:28:38.455 --> 0:28:40.109
Dock... Dock D.

0:28:40.240 --> 0:28:41.676
Let me see.

0:28:44.679 --> 0:28:47.160
Two-stroke engine sprayer pumps?

0:28:47.290 --> 0:28:48.683
This is a department store.

0:28:48.814 --> 0:28:51.338
Does it look like
we use sprayer pumps here?

0:28:51.468 --> 0:28:53.906
Well, we don't.

0:28:54.036 --> 0:28:56.430
I was given this address, ma'am.

0:28:56.560 --> 0:28:58.998
I need to talk
to your supervisor.

0:28:59.128 --> 0:29:01.522
Got it.
You stay right here.

0:29:21.063 --> 0:29:23.544
Dispatch. Steve.

0:29:23.587 --> 0:29:25.024
Yes... this is Kathy Deutsch,

0:29:25.067 --> 0:29:27.504
I'm the manager
of a Lancaster's in Omaha.

0:29:27.548 --> 0:29:28.743
And you guys
just delivered something

0:29:28.767 --> 0:29:31.117
that we did not order.
Really?

0:29:31.247 --> 0:29:34.685
Your guy brought a giant wooden
crate onto my loading dock,

0:29:34.816 --> 0:29:38.037
seems to be some kind
of spraying system.

0:29:38.167 --> 0:29:42.606
The invoice number
is 1-9-6-8-AE35.

0:29:42.737 --> 0:29:45.435
Okay, just, uh, give me a second
to catch up here.

0:29:45.566 --> 0:29:47.742
Uh...
Uh, sprayer pump.

0:29:47.873 --> 0:29:49.004
Yeah, I think I got it.

0:29:49.135 --> 0:29:50.832
Omaha, right?

0:29:50.876 --> 0:29:52.791
Yes, but I run
a department store.

0:29:52.834 --> 0:29:54.705
We don't sell anything
like that.

0:29:54.749 --> 0:29:56.620
Clearly this is a mistake
you need to fix.

0:29:56.751 --> 0:29:59.275
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

0:29:59.406 --> 0:30:02.104
My boss is gonna just...

0:30:02.235 --> 0:30:04.063
Ah, great.

0:30:04.106 --> 0:30:05.847
Ricky's booked solid.

0:30:05.978 --> 0:30:06.935
Ricky?

0:30:06.979 --> 0:30:08.589
He's the driver.

0:30:11.505 --> 0:30:14.595
Well, Ricky's just gonna have
to put the box back on the truck.

0:30:14.638 --> 0:30:16.727
Uh, little problem with that.

0:30:16.771 --> 0:30:18.077
Cargo space.

0:30:18.207 --> 0:30:20.296
He's got a pickup
at the airport in an hour.

0:30:20.427 --> 0:30:22.124
It's a messy one, too.

0:30:22.255 --> 0:30:25.867
It's, uh, nine hundred pounds
of Spanish mackerel.

0:30:25.998 --> 0:30:28.827
Okay. I'm sorry,
but that's not my problem.

0:30:28.870 --> 0:30:30.524
No, I know.
It's just... Wow.

0:30:30.654 --> 0:30:33.527
I mean, if he's late,
that's gonna stink.

0:30:33.657 --> 0:30:35.659
Pun intended.

0:30:35.790 --> 0:30:37.836
Gene?
Everything okay?

0:30:37.966 --> 0:30:40.795
Yep. Oh, I'm just, uh,
putting out fires.

0:30:40.926 --> 0:30:42.405
It's a delivery issue.

0:30:42.536 --> 0:30:43.276
Don't worry.Okay.

0:30:43.406 --> 0:30:45.060
I got it.

0:30:45.191 --> 0:30:47.062
Sorry.

0:30:47.106 --> 0:30:48.934
- You still there?
- Yes.

0:30:49.064 --> 0:30:51.545
Look, I don't know what to
tell you about your fish issue,

0:30:51.675 --> 0:30:53.982
it's just I can't have
a huge box just...

0:30:54.026 --> 0:30:55.462
I-I understand.

0:30:55.505 --> 0:30:56.743
It's just... I mean,
we both have people

0:30:56.767 --> 0:31:00.249
we have to answer to, right?

0:31:00.380 --> 0:31:01.772
Hey, I've got an idea.

0:31:01.816 --> 0:31:03.426
Um, I've got an extra truck.

0:31:03.470 --> 0:31:05.124
I could drive over there myself.

0:31:05.254 --> 0:31:07.996
Great.
How long till you get here?

0:31:08.040 --> 0:31:10.390
Well, I'm just over
in Urbandale.

0:31:10.433 --> 0:31:14.046
Um, so, if I leave right now,
be there in four hours.

0:31:14.176 --> 0:31:16.265
Four hours?
No.

0:31:16.309 --> 0:31:18.137
No, no, it's fine.
I don't mind the drive.

0:31:18.267 --> 0:31:20.067
I'll crank the tunes,
it'll be like old times.

0:31:20.095 --> 0:31:23.142
I mean, no, I can't wait
around that long.

0:31:23.185 --> 0:31:26.275
We're closing
for the night here.

0:31:26.406 --> 0:31:28.016
Oh. Whew.

0:31:32.803 --> 0:31:34.196
How's this?

0:31:34.240 --> 0:31:35.502
Yeah?

0:31:35.632 --> 0:31:38.505
If you promise me that...

0:31:38.635 --> 0:31:43.336
Ricky will get back here
by 10:00 a.m. tomorrow...

0:31:43.466 --> 0:31:45.294
I'll hold the box overnight.

0:31:45.338 --> 0:31:46.774
You would do that?

0:31:46.905 --> 0:31:48.907
Oh, my God.
You're a lifesaver.

0:31:49.037 --> 0:31:50.299
What's your name again?

0:31:50.343 --> 0:31:52.084
Kathy.
Kathy.

0:31:52.214 --> 0:31:55.261
Yeah, my guy'll be there,
10:00 a.m. on the dot.

0:31:55.304 --> 0:31:56.915
With flowers.

0:31:57.045 --> 0:31:59.569
Well, f-flowers
won't be necessary...

0:31:59.700 --> 0:32:01.267
but thanks for the thought.

0:32:01.310 --> 0:32:04.487
No, thank you.

0:32:40.697 --> 0:32:42.221
G'night, ladies.

0:32:42.351 --> 0:32:44.092
'Night.
Good night, Gene.

0:33:08.377 --> 0:33:09.422
Gentlemen. Hey, Gene.

0:33:09.552 --> 0:33:11.641
Heya, Gene.

0:33:11.772 --> 0:33:13.600
Well, better hit it.

0:33:13.730 --> 0:33:16.255
Good luck to Lizzie
on that spelling bee.

0:33:16.385 --> 0:33:17.256
She's a little nervous.

0:33:17.386 --> 0:33:18.822
Nah, she's gonna be great.

0:33:18.953 --> 0:33:21.260
Yeah. Hey,
Huskers are back.

0:33:21.390 --> 0:33:22.826
Ohh.

0:33:22.957 --> 0:33:24.326
Probably heard me screaming
all the way in Lincoln.

0:33:24.350 --> 0:33:26.656
I was hoarse.

0:33:26.787 --> 0:33:28.963
Uh, and Martinez... ahh.

0:33:29.094 --> 0:33:31.879
484 yards?
That's a freshman record!

0:33:32.010 --> 0:33:33.054
Wow.
You know what?

0:33:33.185 --> 0:33:34.534
I love that kid.

0:33:34.664 --> 0:33:37.015
Hey, if he and Kinnie
keep it up,

0:33:37.145 --> 0:33:38.494
I think they still got a shot.

0:33:38.625 --> 0:33:40.975
Ohh.
Your lips to God's ears.

0:33:42.672 --> 0:33:44.022
Ahh. Okay.

0:33:45.893 --> 0:33:46.894
Wow.

0:33:47.025 --> 0:33:49.766
Mmm.

0:33:49.897 --> 0:33:51.290
Mm-mm-mmm.

0:33:55.424 --> 0:33:57.296
Hm-hmm.

0:33:57.426 --> 0:33:59.037
Mm-mm-mmm.

0:33:59.167 --> 0:34:00.690
Hello, gorgeous.

0:34:04.738 --> 0:34:06.305
Mmm.

0:34:41.470 --> 0:34:44.647
One, Armani suits and run.

0:34:44.778 --> 0:34:47.128
Armani, Armani, Armani.

0:34:47.259 --> 0:34:48.434
Armani.

0:34:48.564 --> 0:34:49.564
Armani?

0:34:49.609 --> 0:34:51.089
Armani.

0:34:57.007 --> 0:35:00.098
Two, Air Jordan shoes for you.

0:35:03.840 --> 0:35:05.451
Alright.

0:35:12.632 --> 0:35:15.504
Three, linen shirts for free.

0:35:15.635 --> 0:35:18.551
One, two, three.

0:35:18.681 --> 0:35:20.988
Four, cashmere sweaters
out the door.

0:35:21.119 --> 0:35:24.513
No.
Yes, yes, yes.

0:35:24.644 --> 0:35:27.299
One, two, three.

0:35:27.429 --> 0:35:31.694
Five, Patagonias to survive.

0:35:35.133 --> 0:35:36.525
6,000 more seats.

0:35:36.656 --> 0:35:38.832
6,000 more fans.

0:35:38.962 --> 0:35:41.574
I don't know.
All those luxury suites?

0:35:41.704 --> 0:35:43.880
Start saving now.
Hm.

0:35:44.011 --> 0:35:45.839
Mm, you see that interview
with Pelini?

0:35:45.969 --> 0:35:47.580
The guy's feeling his oats.

0:35:47.710 --> 0:35:49.321
He can taste it now.

0:35:49.451 --> 0:35:51.584
You think he'll ever get outta
Osborne's shadow?

0:35:51.714 --> 0:35:53.716
Mm.
Osborne... what a career.

0:35:53.847 --> 0:35:55.327
Wow.

0:35:55.370 --> 0:35:57.894
I mean, a hall of famer
and a congressman?

0:35:58.025 --> 0:35:59.461
Mm.
Unbelievable.

0:35:59.592 --> 0:36:02.116
Seven, spendy dresses
sent from heaven.

0:36:07.643 --> 0:36:08.905
Mm-mm-mmm.

0:36:09.036 --> 0:36:10.907
'95 team?

0:36:11.038 --> 0:36:12.996
Wow.
What a line up.

0:36:13.127 --> 0:36:14.998
I mean,
the "I formation."

0:36:15.129 --> 0:36:17.914
Well, I'll tell ya, Pelini could
have taken a page outta that book.

0:36:18.045 --> 0:36:19.960
Nine, pricey lingerie is mine.

0:36:22.310 --> 0:36:25.444
Ten, calfskin briefcases
for men.

0:36:25.574 --> 0:36:27.446
Apples and oranges, my friend.

0:36:27.576 --> 0:36:28.838
Aw.
Oh, come on.

0:36:28.969 --> 0:36:30.666
Osborne had the great
Tommie Frazier.

0:36:30.797 --> 0:36:32.035
Frazier! Yeah, say it with me.
Frazier. Yeah, sure, sure.

0:36:32.059 --> 0:36:34.061
Huh? Say it with me.

0:36:34.192 --> 0:36:37.630
Twelve, luxury pumps
to un-shelve.

0:36:37.760 --> 0:36:40.198
How about that 44-21 win
against the Buffs?

0:36:40.328 --> 0:36:42.635
Ahh.
Be still my heart.

0:36:42.765 --> 0:36:44.289
Mmm.

0:36:44.419 --> 0:36:47.727
Seventy-six yard pass
to Reggie Baul and...

0:36:47.857 --> 0:36:49.076
And never sacked once.

0:36:49.207 --> 0:36:51.992
Wow. You have got
quite a memory.

0:36:54.168 --> 0:36:56.126
Yeah, well, uh,
I'll tell you what.

0:36:56.257 --> 0:36:58.041
I can remember every stitch
of clothing

0:36:58.172 --> 0:36:59.695
I was wearing during that game,

0:36:59.826 --> 0:37:01.506
but ask me what I had
for dinner last night

0:37:01.610 --> 0:37:03.090
and clean slate.

0:37:03.221 --> 0:37:04.831
Yeah.
Tell me about it.

0:37:06.963 --> 0:37:08.574
Mm.

0:37:14.319 --> 0:37:16.035
Well, I tell ya, if you're
not passing the ball,

0:37:16.059 --> 0:37:18.236
that's what's gonna happen.

0:37:18.366 --> 0:37:19.366
Mmm.

0:37:19.411 --> 0:37:21.935
Eighteen, Kate Spade's queen.

0:37:24.024 --> 0:37:27.767
Nineteen, Calvin leathers
on the scene.

0:37:27.897 --> 0:37:29.943
Twenty, Uggs look funny.

0:37:33.251 --> 0:37:36.515
Sure looks pretty, Huskers red
against that green.

0:37:36.645 --> 0:37:38.299
It's like Christmas out there.

0:37:44.479 --> 0:37:46.438
Ahh! Ugh!

0:37:48.744 --> 0:37:49.919
You okay?

0:37:50.050 --> 0:37:52.879
Mm-hmm.
Wrong pipe.

0:37:53.009 --> 0:37:55.577
Oh.
Oh, okay.

0:37:55.708 --> 0:37:58.537
Mmm. Ohh.

0:37:58.667 --> 0:38:00.713
So, you think our guys
are gonna move to the Big Ten

0:38:00.843 --> 0:38:03.542
like they're saying?

0:38:03.672 --> 0:38:04.978
Big Ten?

0:38:05.108 --> 0:38:06.428
Yeah. I mean,
they're just chasing

0:38:06.545 --> 0:38:08.460
the, you know, mighty dollar,
if you ask me.

0:38:08.590 --> 0:38:11.419
I mean, both powerhouses,
'course.

0:38:11.550 --> 0:38:15.989
But, you know, you got
Oklahoma and Texas over here.

0:38:16.119 --> 0:38:21.342
But Michigan,
Ohio State over there.

0:38:21.473 --> 0:38:24.563
I-I don't know.

0:38:24.693 --> 0:38:27.261
Guess I like tradition.

0:38:27.392 --> 0:38:31.352
Mmm.
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mmm-mmm!

0:38:31.483 --> 0:38:32.788
So good.

0:38:32.919 --> 0:38:34.834
That center.
Mm.

0:38:34.964 --> 0:38:36.488
Just amazing.

0:38:36.618 --> 0:38:38.272
Mm-mm-mmm.

0:38:38.403 --> 0:38:39.752
Wow. Mmm.

0:38:39.882 --> 0:38:41.928
Oh, God.

0:38:42.058 --> 0:38:44.365
What am I doing?

0:38:44.496 --> 0:38:46.280
What?

0:38:46.411 --> 0:38:48.761
Look at me!
I don't know.

0:38:48.891 --> 0:38:51.285
I-I don't know.

0:38:51.416 --> 0:38:52.547
Oh, Jesus.

0:38:52.678 --> 0:38:53.678
Gene?

0:38:55.898 --> 0:38:58.118
Oh, God.

0:38:58.248 --> 0:38:59.815
You...

0:39:02.078 --> 0:39:04.516
You have a wife, right, Frank?

0:39:04.646 --> 0:39:05.517
Well, yeah.
Yeah?

0:39:05.647 --> 0:39:06.866
Yeah.

0:39:06.996 --> 0:39:09.738
And she's waiting for you.

0:39:09.869 --> 0:39:12.001
Look at me.

0:39:12.132 --> 0:39:14.134
I got...

0:39:14.264 --> 0:39:17.790
I got no one.

0:39:17.920 --> 0:39:19.922
My parents are dead.

0:39:20.053 --> 0:39:21.533
Oh.

0:39:21.663 --> 0:39:23.143
My brother...

0:39:29.105 --> 0:39:31.804
My brother is dead.

0:39:31.934 --> 0:39:33.849
I, uh...

0:39:37.549 --> 0:39:40.639
I got no wife...

0:39:40.769 --> 0:39:42.554
No kids.

0:39:42.684 --> 0:39:44.817
No friends.

0:39:44.947 --> 0:39:47.820
If I died tonight...

0:39:47.950 --> 0:39:50.213
no one would care.

0:39:50.344 --> 0:39:51.824
What difference would it make?

0:39:51.954 --> 0:39:54.043
Gene, buddy...

0:39:54.174 --> 0:39:59.222
No, I-I-I'm sure that you mean
a lot to, you know...

0:39:59.353 --> 0:40:00.876
To a lot of... lots of people.

0:40:01.007 --> 0:40:06.055
If I died tonight, my landlord
would pack up my stuff.

0:40:06.186 --> 0:40:09.319
It'd take him three hours.

0:40:09.450 --> 0:40:13.454
And Cinnabon would just
hire a new manager.

0:40:13.585 --> 0:40:14.716
Gene who?

0:40:14.847 --> 0:40:16.022
Poof!

0:40:16.152 --> 0:40:19.547
I'd be gone.
I'd be...

0:40:19.678 --> 0:40:21.810
a...

0:40:21.941 --> 0:40:23.725
a ghost.

0:40:23.856 --> 0:40:28.991
Less than a ghost.
I'd be a... a sha... shadow.

0:40:31.341 --> 0:40:33.256
I'd just be...

0:40:33.387 --> 0:40:34.997
nothing.

0:40:39.219 --> 0:40:43.136
I mean, Frank...
What's the point, Frank?

0:40:49.011 --> 0:40:50.970
What's the poi...

0:41:06.202 --> 0:41:09.118
Ah.

0:41:09.249 --> 0:41:11.381
Oh, you... I'm so sorry.

0:41:11.512 --> 0:41:12.948
You didn't need to hear
any of that.

0:41:13.079 --> 0:41:15.168
No, no, no, no, no,
that's... that's okay.

0:41:15.298 --> 0:41:16.909
No, that... that is okay.

0:41:19.128 --> 0:41:21.043
Everybody has bad days.

0:41:21.174 --> 0:41:22.741
You've felt like this?

0:41:25.265 --> 0:41:28.964
No, I mean, not me...
But people.

0:41:29.095 --> 0:41:30.792
I-I think a lot of people.

0:41:30.923 --> 0:41:34.709
Yeah, I mean, i-it's just like
life's ups and life's downs.

0:41:34.840 --> 0:41:37.538
Yeah.

0:41:37.669 --> 0:41:39.453
Hey, you're not gonna tell
Nick, are you?

0:41:39.584 --> 0:41:40.933
Oh.

0:41:41.063 --> 0:41:43.413
No, 'course not.

0:41:43.544 --> 0:41:45.981
Well... thanks so much
for listening.

0:41:46.112 --> 0:41:48.636
Yeah, no, no.
No p... No problem.

0:43:15.941 --> 0:43:17.072
I don't know.

0:43:17.203 --> 0:43:19.553
I'm thinking maybe
blue or black?

0:43:19.684 --> 0:43:20.859
What's the occasion?

0:43:20.989 --> 0:43:21.989
My sister's wedding.

0:43:22.034 --> 0:43:23.601
Oh, very exciting.

0:43:23.731 --> 0:43:25.167
Um, what size are you?

0:43:25.298 --> 0:43:27.082
Usually a 38 or a 40?

0:43:27.213 --> 0:43:28.431
Do you want to try both?

0:43:28.562 --> 0:43:29.781
Yeah.
Let's do it.

0:43:32.174 --> 0:43:34.873
Sir, do you need help?

0:43:35.003 --> 0:43:36.483
I'm good.

0:43:36.614 --> 0:43:38.877
Well, Barbara's right here
if you need anything.

0:43:39.007 --> 0:43:40.226
Mm-hmm.

0:43:40.356 --> 0:43:42.707
Kathy, is this it? Yes.

0:43:42.837 --> 0:43:45.884
Excuse me, ma'am? Truck's here
to pick up that big box.

0:43:46.014 --> 0:43:47.276
Great, thank you.

0:43:47.407 --> 0:43:49.496
Uh...
the guy brought flowers?

0:43:49.627 --> 0:43:51.150
Really?

0:44:20.832 --> 0:44:23.878
Look. Ooh la la! Ooh la la!

0:44:26.228 --> 0:44:27.839
Oh.
Check this out.

0:44:27.882 --> 0:44:29.623
Buongiorno, ladies!

0:44:29.754 --> 0:44:30.905
How much you think
we can get for 'em?

0:44:30.929 --> 0:44:32.529
I don't know.
Maybe... five hundred each?

0:44:32.626 --> 0:44:33.671
But shit, man.

0:44:33.801 --> 0:44:35.368
Maybe I just keep 'em
for myself.

0:44:35.498 --> 0:44:36.891
I've been eyeing these Jordans.

0:44:37.022 --> 0:44:40.547
You guys enjoying yourselves?

0:44:40.678 --> 0:44:41.838
Well, hold onto that feeling.

0:44:41.896 --> 0:44:43.419
'Cause this is it.

0:44:43.550 --> 0:44:44.551
Yeah, we know.

0:44:44.682 --> 0:44:46.292
Well, in case you forget...

0:44:46.422 --> 0:44:47.772
You transported stolen goods

0:44:47.902 --> 0:44:49.817
with a value exceeding
five thousand dollars.

0:44:49.948 --> 0:44:52.559
And the truck you used to do it
was rented in Council Bluffs,

0:44:52.690 --> 0:44:53.952
across state lines.

0:44:54.082 --> 0:44:56.389
You told us to rent
the truck over there...

0:44:56.519 --> 0:44:58.043
Theft from
an Interstate Shipment.

0:44:58.173 --> 0:44:59.740
Up to ten years.

0:44:59.871 --> 0:45:01.831
Transportation of Stolen Goods.
Another ten years.

0:45:01.873 --> 0:45:03.788
Sale of Stolen Goods.
Ten years.

0:45:03.918 --> 0:45:05.659
Conspiracy to commit
a federal crime...

0:45:05.790 --> 0:45:08.793
Whoa, whoa. "Conspiracy"?
It was your idea.

0:45:08.923 --> 0:45:11.709
Yeah. It's called
"mutually assured destruction."

0:45:11.839 --> 0:45:15.974
So, if I go down, you go down.

0:45:16.104 --> 0:45:17.299
Man, you don't
havta threaten us.

0:45:17.323 --> 0:45:18.716
We're all friends here.

0:45:21.631 --> 0:45:24.330
I am not your friend.

0:45:24.460 --> 0:45:25.940
And if you get greedy
and you decide

0:45:26.071 --> 0:45:28.900
to come back for more, don't.

0:45:29.030 --> 0:45:30.771
Gene Takavic...
You never heard of him.

0:45:30.902 --> 0:45:33.339
The Cottonwood Mall?
You don't go there.

0:45:33.469 --> 0:45:37.778
You see me coming, you cross
to the other side of the street.

0:45:37.909 --> 0:45:39.388
Dude...

0:45:39.519 --> 0:45:42.565
Now I need you to say it:
"we're done."

0:45:44.611 --> 0:45:46.526
Come on! Say it.

0:45:46.656 --> 0:45:48.963
"We're. Done."

0:45:49.094 --> 0:45:50.530
Say it.

0:46:00.279 --> 0:46:03.238
We're done.

0:46:03.369 --> 0:46:06.154
We're... We're done.

0:46:06.285 --> 0:46:07.721
Gene?

0:46:11.159 --> 0:46:13.335
Hey, Gene, I see your car!

0:46:17.731 --> 0:46:19.472
Gene?

0:46:30.918 --> 0:46:32.833
Well, that's a start.

0:46:32.964 --> 0:46:35.662
Looks like your problem
is the master cylinder.

0:46:35.793 --> 0:46:39.013
Look at you boys, hard at work.

0:46:39.144 --> 0:46:42.843
Well, Marion, guys,
I got to get going.

0:46:42.974 --> 0:46:45.150
I will take another look
next time.

0:46:45.280 --> 0:46:46.847
Wait a minute.

0:46:46.978 --> 0:46:48.607
No, you can't go anywhere
looking like that.

0:46:48.631 --> 0:46:51.025
Come on inside and wash up.

0:46:51.156 --> 0:46:53.071
Ma...

0:46:53.201 --> 0:46:55.638
Jeffie, don't vex me.
Come on, Gene.

0:46:55.769 --> 0:46:56.877
You can help me
with the groceries.

0:46:56.901 --> 0:46:59.599
Huh, Gene? Sounds like a plan.

0:47:11.219 --> 0:47:13.395
Nice of you to
help Jeffie with his car.

0:47:15.223 --> 0:47:18.748
You might not know it, but
my boy's had some tough times.

0:47:18.879 --> 0:47:23.666
He, uh... He fell in with
a bad crowd back in Albuquerque.

0:47:23.797 --> 0:47:27.105
Albuquerque, huh?
Never been.

0:47:27.235 --> 0:47:29.063
Lucky you.

0:47:29.194 --> 0:47:31.892
But things are so much better
for Jeffie here.

0:47:32.023 --> 0:47:35.156
Even more so
now that he knows you.

0:47:35.287 --> 0:47:38.507
You're a good influence, Gene.

0:47:38.638 --> 0:47:39.726
Oh, where's my brain?

0:47:39.857 --> 0:47:43.121
I keep forgetting to ask you
about Nippy.

0:47:44.600 --> 0:47:45.645
Nippy?

0:47:45.775 --> 0:47:48.648
Oh, oh, right.

0:47:48.778 --> 0:47:49.605
You're not gonna believe this,

0:47:49.736 --> 0:47:51.956
but, uh, he was with a family

0:47:52.086 --> 0:47:54.045
the whole time, just...
Just a few blocks away.

0:47:54.175 --> 0:47:55.481
Oh, well, that's wonderful!

0:47:55.611 --> 0:47:57.265
Yeah.
He's in great shape.

0:47:57.396 --> 0:48:01.095
So, after all that...

0:48:01.226 --> 0:48:03.097
a happy ending.

0:48:03.228 --> 0:48:04.751
Oh, well...

0:48:15.414 --> 0:48:17.503
Here you go, Ma'am.
Thanks.

0:48:17.633 --> 0:48:19.548
And looky here.

0:48:22.900 --> 0:48:25.250
For you, m'lady. Thank you.

0:48:28.514 --> 0:48:31.125
Hey, Gene,
aren't you taking lunch?

0:48:31.256 --> 0:48:32.866
Huh?

0:48:35.477 --> 0:48:37.175
Thanks.

0:50:38.252 --> 0:50:42.430
I get it.
You get over it, okay?

0:50:42.561 --> 0:50:44.258
Please, believe me.

0:50:44.389 --> 0:50:47.740
Before you know it,
you'll forget all about it.

0:50:49.046 --> 0:50:50.438
Go.
