<b>That's it.</b>

0:00:28.903 --> 0:00:31.698
<b>Can I just, you know,
look at it for a minute?</b>

0:00:33.158 --> 0:00:34.701
<b>You're an artist, Sid.</b>

0:00:37.120 --> 0:00:39.122
<b>You're telling me
you're just gonna walk out of here</b>

0:00:39.205 --> 0:00:41.166
<b>and I'm never going
to see it again?</b>

0:00:41.249 --> 0:00:42.792
<b>There's a good chance
of that, yes.</b>

0:00:44.210 --> 0:00:45.879
<b>Most guys, you know,
for the first one,</b>

0:00:45.962 --> 0:00:47.589
<b>they start
with something small.</b>

0:00:47.672 --> 0:00:50.258
<b>"Mom," girlfriend's initials,
something like that.</b>

0:00:50.925 --> 0:00:53.219
<b>Not you.</b>

0:00:53.303 --> 0:00:56.514
<b>You get a full set of sleeves,
all in a couple of months.</b>

0:00:56.598 --> 0:00:58.933
<b>Takes guys a few years
to get the ink you got.</b>

0:01:00.310 --> 0:01:02.062
<b>I don't have
a few years.</b>

0:01:03.646 --> 0:01:05.398
<b>Wish to hell I did.</b>

0:01:59.536 --> 0:02:00.829
<b>The vault. Open it.</b>

0:02:00.912 --> 0:02:02.997
<b>We can't. The branch
manager's not here.</b>

0:02:05.208 --> 0:02:06.876
<b>-Where is he?
-It's lunchtime.</b>

0:02:06.960 --> 0:02:08.044
<b>He's at White Castle.</b>

0:02:08.461 --> 0:02:09.337
<b>White Castle?</b>

0:02:09.420 --> 0:02:10.463
<b>It's a fast food restaurant.</b>

0:02:10.547 --> 0:02:13.508
<b>They serve
those little square burgers.</b>

0:02:14.050 --> 0:02:15.301
<b>I know what it is.</b>

0:02:17.762 --> 0:02:19.055
<b>I'm not playing games.</b>

0:02:19.430 --> 0:02:20.557
<b>Open it.</b>

0:02:20.640 --> 0:02:22.809
<b>Sir, you have a half
a million dollars cash in your bag.</b>

0:02:22.892 --> 0:02:24.727
<b>Don't you think
it would be better...</b>

0:02:35.572 --> 0:02:37.240
<b>This is the police.</b>

0:02:37.323 --> 0:02:39.659
<b>You are completely surrounded.</b>

0:02:41.911 --> 0:02:43.246
<b>Put down your weapon.</b>

0:02:45.665 --> 0:02:47.667
<b>Put down your weapons now.</b>

0:02:52.046 --> 0:02:53.840
<b>Rarely in the case
of armed robbery</b>

0:02:53.923 --> 0:02:55.925
<b>do we hear a plea
of no contest.</b>

0:02:56.009 --> 0:02:58.052
<b>Are you sure about this,
Mr. Scofield?</b>

0:02:58.136 --> 0:02:59.637
<b>I'm sure, Your Honor.</b>

0:02:59.721 --> 0:03:01.848
<b>Your Honor, we'd like
to recess if we could.</b>

0:03:01.931 --> 0:03:03.766
<b>My client's a bit confused
at the moment.</b>

0:03:03.850 --> 0:03:04.684
<b>I'm not, Your Honor.</b>

0:03:04.767 --> 0:03:06.060
<b>He is, Your Honor.</b>

0:03:06.144 --> 0:03:08.563
<b>Perhaps you should heed
your representation's advice,</b>

0:03:08.646 --> 0:03:11.274
<b>take some additional time
to consider your response.</b>

0:03:11.357 --> 0:03:12.650
<b>I've already done that,
Your Honor.</b>

0:03:19.199 --> 0:03:21.868
<b>I'll retire to my chambers
to determine sentencing.</b>

0:03:21.951 --> 0:03:23.786
<b>Court's recessed until 1:30.</b>

0:03:26.122 --> 0:03:27.040
<b>Come on, let's go.</b>

0:03:27.123 --> 0:03:28.166
<b>Uncle Mike?</b>

0:03:30.627 --> 0:03:32.003
<b>I didn't want you to come.</b>

0:03:32.629 --> 0:03:34.297
<b>Go home, LJ.</b>

0:03:34.589 --> 0:03:36.299
<b>I didn't want you
to see this.</b>

0:03:43.890 --> 0:03:45.058
<b>He's not gonna
take this well.</b>

0:03:45.141 --> 0:03:47.018
<b>Can you blame him?
He's your nephew.</b>

0:03:47.101 --> 0:03:48.102
<b>He's beginning
to get the idea</b>

0:03:48.186 --> 0:03:49.729
<b>that anybody
he attaches himself to</b>

0:03:49.812 --> 0:03:51.648
<b>is gonna
end up in prison...</b>

0:03:51.731 --> 0:03:52.649
<b>And he's not the only one</b>

0:03:52.732 --> 0:03:54.108
<b>who's starting to feel
that way, Michael.</b>

0:03:55.985 --> 0:03:57.403
<b>Will you give us a minute?</b>

0:03:57.487 --> 0:03:58.446
<b>One minute.</b>

0:03:59.155 --> 0:04:00.782
<b>Don't you understand?</b>

0:04:00.865 --> 0:04:02.367
<b>You just put the book
in that woman's hand</b>

0:04:02.450 --> 0:04:04.577
<b>and she's gonna lob it
at you like a grenade.</b>

0:04:04.661 --> 0:04:07.121
<b>Justice and punishment
are the same thing to her.</b>

0:04:07.413 --> 0:04:08.539
<b>I know.</b>

0:04:08.623 --> 0:04:10.917
<b>Then will you please tell me
what's going through your head?</b>

0:04:11.000 --> 0:04:12.043
<b>We've been over this.</b>

0:04:12.126 --> 0:04:13.419
<b>I've known you
my entire life.</b>

0:04:13.503 --> 0:04:15.838
<b>You don't have
a violent bone in your body,</b>

0:04:15.922 --> 0:04:17.799
<b>and I know you didn't
need the money.</b>

0:04:17.882 --> 0:04:18.758
<b>Veronica.</b>

0:04:18.841 --> 0:04:20.760
<b>Why won't you
let me help you?</b>

0:04:20.843 --> 0:04:22.053
<b>You've been good to me.</b>

0:04:22.136 --> 0:04:23.763
<b>My whole life, you have.</b>

0:04:24.931 --> 0:04:26.349
<b>But you've gotta let me
deal with this.</b>

0:04:26.683 --> 0:04:28.434
<b>Okay?</b>

0:04:28.977 --> 0:04:30.770
<b>Given your lack
of prior criminal conduct,</b>

0:04:31.396 --> 0:04:33.940
<b>I am inclined
toward probation.</b>

0:04:34.023 --> 0:04:36.150
<b>However, the fact that
you discharged a deadly weapon</b>

0:04:36.234 --> 0:04:39.112
<b>during the commission
of the crime suggests malice to me.</b>

0:04:39.195 --> 0:04:41.364
<b>For that reason,
I find it incumbent</b>

0:04:41.447 --> 0:04:44.242
<b>that you see the inside
of a prison cell, Mr. Scofield.</b>

0:04:45.368 --> 0:04:47.954
<b>It says here
that you've requested to be incarcerated</b>

0:04:48.037 --> 0:04:50.123
<b>somewhere near your home
here in Chicago.</b>

0:04:50.206 --> 0:04:51.791
<b>I'm willing to honor that.</b>

0:04:51.874 --> 0:04:53.376
<b>The closest
level one facility to--</b>

0:04:53.459 --> 0:04:54.294
<b>Level one?</b>

0:04:54.377 --> 0:04:56.254
<b>That's maximum security,
Your Honor.</b>

0:04:56.337 --> 0:04:59.590
<b>I would ask counsel to refrain
from interrupting me.</b>

0:04:59.674 --> 0:05:00.633
<b>As I was saying,</b>

0:05:00.717 --> 0:05:02.135
<b>the closest
level one facility</b>

0:05:02.218 --> 0:05:04.220
<b>would be Fox River
State Penitentiary.</b>

0:05:04.304 --> 0:05:05.888
<b>As for the term
of your sentence,</b>

0:05:05.972 --> 0:05:07.473
<b>I'm setting it
at five years.</b>

0:05:07.557 --> 0:05:09.976
<b>You'll be eligible for parole
in half that time.</b>

0:05:10.059 --> 0:05:12.437
<b>Sentence to be carried out immediately.</b>

0:05:25.575 --> 0:05:28.119
<b>Okay, step inside the door
and check yourself for bugs.</b>

0:05:28.202 --> 0:05:29.662
<b>When you hear
the knock, step out.</b>

0:05:29.746 --> 0:05:31.039
<b>Keep the line moving.</b>

0:05:31.122 --> 0:05:33.166
<b>We ain't got all day
to get this done.</b>

0:05:33.249 --> 0:05:34.667
<b>- Let's go. Move it.
- No more talking in line.</b>

0:05:34.751 --> 0:05:36.794
<b>Move it. You got less
than five minutes to take a shower.</b>

0:05:36.878 --> 0:05:38.421
<b>Keep the line moving.
Keep it moving.</b>

0:05:38.504 --> 0:05:41.049
<b>- Move it. Right now. Let's go. Move, move.
- Next!</b>

0:05:44.218 --> 0:05:45.553
<b>Name and back number.</b>

0:05:45.636 --> 0:05:46.888
<b>Scofield, Michael.</b>

<b>94941.</b>

<b>Are you
a religious man, Scofield?</b>

0:05:49.640 --> 0:05:50.641
<b>Never really
thought about it.</b>

0:05:50.725 --> 0:05:51.726
<b>Good, 'cause
the Ten Commandments</b>

0:05:51.809 --> 0:05:52.935
<b>don't mean
a box of piss in here.</b>

0:05:53.019 --> 0:05:54.145
<b>We got two commandments
and two only.</b>

0:05:54.228 --> 0:05:56.898
<b>The first commandment
is you got nothing coming.</b>

0:05:56.981 --> 0:05:58.358
<b>What's the second commandment?</b>

0:05:58.441 --> 0:05:59.525
<b>See commandment number one.</b>

0:05:59.609 --> 0:06:01.152
<b>Gotcha.</b>

0:06:02.445 --> 0:06:03.988
<b>You talking out the side
of your neck?</b>

0:06:04.530 --> 0:06:05.573
<b>Come again?</b>

0:06:05.656 --> 0:06:08.576
<b>I said, are you
being a smartass?</b>

0:06:08.659 --> 0:06:11.079
<b>Just trying to fly low,
avoid the radar, boss.</b>

0:06:11.162 --> 0:06:12.955
<b>Do my time... and get out.</b>

0:06:14.332 --> 0:06:16.125
<b>There isn't any flying
under my radar.</b>

0:06:17.126 --> 0:06:18.127
<b>Good to know.</b>

0:06:39.315 --> 0:06:41.609
<b>Hey, can a brother
get some air conditioning up here, cuz?</b>

0:06:41.692 --> 0:06:43.778
<b>It's hotter than

0:06:43.861 --> 0:06:46.197
<b>To hell with the AC, man.
Give me the crack ho.</b>

0:06:49.659 --> 0:06:50.910
<b>Come on!</b>

0:06:54.205 --> 0:06:55.248
<b>Yo, Fish!</b>

<b>What you looking at?</b>

0:06:56.791 --> 0:06:58.835
<b>You look kind of pretty

0:07:05.508 --> 0:07:07.885
<b>Ain't nothing to do up in here

0:07:07.969 --> 0:07:09.929
<b>Ain't nobody

0:07:25.695 --> 0:07:27.238
<b>Welcome to

0:07:34.912 --> 0:07:36.747
<b>...is now

0:07:54.182 --> 0:07:55.975
<b>You wanna talk
about it?</b>

0:07:56.058 --> 0:07:57.685
<b>No, it's not
worth talking about.</b>

0:07:57.768 --> 0:08:00.021
<b>If it's keeping you up,
it is.</b>

0:08:00.104 --> 0:08:01.689
<b>Oh, it's just...</b>

0:08:01.772 --> 0:08:03.733
<b>It's nothing, you know.</b>

0:08:04.942 --> 0:08:05.943
<b>Michael's case.</b>

0:08:07.111 --> 0:08:08.529
<b>You did the best you could.</b>

0:08:08.613 --> 0:08:10.114
<b>Yeah, but he didn't.</b>

0:08:11.491 --> 0:08:12.408
<b>He just sort of rolled over.</b>

0:08:12.492 --> 0:08:14.118
<b>He didn't put up a fight.</b>

0:08:14.202 --> 0:08:15.077
<b>It's not like him.</b>

0:08:17.205 --> 0:08:19.290
<b>I'm sorry. I shouldn't
be talking about him.</b>

0:08:19.373 --> 0:08:22.293
<b>Hey, if it's on your mind,
it's on your mind, right?</b>

0:08:24.378 --> 0:08:25.671
<b>Good night.</b>

<b>All wings, guard coming out.</b>

<b>All wings,

<b>Trey Street Deuces

<b>Nortenos got the bleachers.</b>

<b>Woods got the weight pile.</b>

0:08:51.072 --> 0:08:52.657
<b>The C.O.s got the rest.</b>

0:08:52.740 --> 0:08:56.452
<b>I'm telling you, the guards
are the dirtiest gang in this whole place.</b>

0:08:56.536 --> 0:08:58.329
<b>The only difference
between us and them...</b>

0:08:58.412 --> 0:08:59.997
<b>is the badge.</b>

0:09:00.081 --> 0:09:01.040
<b>Who's the pet lover?</b>

0:09:01.123 --> 0:09:02.917
<b>He'll deny it,

<b>Parachuted out of a plane

0:09:07.171 --> 0:09:08.839
<b>Doesn't look

0:09:08.923 --> 0:09:09.924
<b>Who does?</b>

0:09:10.007 --> 0:09:12.176
<b>Hey! What up, Wholesale?</b>

0:09:12.260 --> 0:09:13.928
<b>-You okay?
-Gonna be greater later.</b>

0:09:14.011 --> 0:09:14.845
<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>What you doing

<b>Wholesale's got it wired up

<b>Anything you want,

<b>You keep

<b>I swear I'm gonna
bust your grape.</b>

0:09:25.815 --> 0:09:27.775
<b>Man, you couldn't bust a grape in Napa

<b>-What are you talking about?
-Man, you want to bump your gums.</b>

<b>Oh, no, no. Now you're

0:09:59.765 --> 0:10:01.350
<b>I'm looking for someone.</b>

<b>Guy named Lincoln Burrows.</b>

<b>Linc the Sink?</b>

<b>That what

0:10:08.024 --> 0:10:09.275
<b>Yeah.</b>

0:10:09.358 --> 0:10:11.277
<b>As in, he'll come at you

0:10:11.360 --> 0:10:12.486
<b>Snowflake.</b>

0:10:12.570 --> 0:10:13.988
<b>Where can I find him?</b>

0:10:15.448 --> 0:10:17.533
<b>Man killed

<b>In a month,

<b>which means no one up this river

<b>'cause he's got
nothing to lose now.</b>

0:10:23.289 --> 0:10:25.458
<b>What are they gonna do?

<b>There a way

0:10:26.500 --> 0:10:28.336
<b>Oh, no. The only time
those boys get out</b>

0:10:28.419 --> 0:10:29.879
<b>is for chapel and P.I.</b>

0:10:30.546 --> 0:10:32.173
<b>P.I.? What's that?</b>

0:10:32.256 --> 0:10:33.174
<b>Prison Industry.</b>

<b>Why's that?</b>

<b>'Cause John Abruzzi runs it.</b>

<b>Why you wanna see Burrows
so bad anyhow?</b>

0:10:57.114 --> 0:10:58.574
<b>Because he's my brother.</b>

0:11:21.806 --> 0:11:22.807
<b>They denied the motion.</b>

0:11:22.890 --> 0:11:23.808
<b>Then do it again.</b>

0:11:23.891 --> 0:11:24.850
<b>I can't. That's it.</b>

0:11:24.934 --> 0:11:27.019
<b>May 11th.
That's the date, man.</b>

0:11:27.103 --> 0:11:28.604
<b>That's the date they,
uh, you know...</b>

0:11:29.271 --> 0:11:30.356
<b>execute me.</b>

0:11:30.856 --> 0:11:32.108
<b>I know.</b>

0:11:37.780 --> 0:11:39.657
<b>I didn't
kill that man, Michael.</b>

0:11:39.740 --> 0:11:41.117
<b>The evidence says you did.</b>

0:11:41.200 --> 0:11:42.660
<b>I don't care
what the evidence says.</b>

0:11:42.743 --> 0:11:43.619
<b>I didn't kill him.</b>

0:11:44.787 --> 0:11:46.080
<b>Swear to me.</b>

0:11:48.124 --> 0:11:49.542
<b>I swear to you, Michael.</b>

0:11:55.297 --> 0:11:57.925
<b>But how did they get it wrong then?</b>

0:11:58.008 --> 0:11:59.468
<b>The courts,
the appeals.</b>

0:11:59.552 --> 0:12:01.929
<b>Don't know. Don't know.</b>

0:12:02.012 --> 0:12:03.889
<b>All I keep thinking,
looking back on it is, uh...</b>

0:12:03.973 --> 0:12:05.015
<b>I was set up.</b>

0:12:06.308 --> 0:12:07.393
<b>And whoever it was
that set me up</b>

0:12:07.476 --> 0:12:09.562
<b>wants me in the ground
as quickly as possible.</b>

0:12:15.151 --> 0:12:16.861
<b>What's another word
for "love"?</b>

0:12:16.944 --> 0:12:18.237
<b>What's the context?</b>

0:12:18.320 --> 0:12:19.572
<b>Oh, you know.</b>

0:12:19.655 --> 0:12:20.990
<b>The "I love you so much</b>

0:12:21.073 --> 0:12:23.826
<b>I ain't never knocking over
a liquor store again" context.</b>

0:12:23.909 --> 0:12:25.327
<b>Except, you know, classy.</b>

0:12:25.619 --> 0:12:27.246
<b>Mmm.</b>

0:12:27.329 --> 0:12:29.206
<b>I'm proposing to my girl,
if you gotta know.</b>

0:12:29.665 --> 0:12:30.583
<b>In a letter?</b>

0:12:30.666 --> 0:12:31.500
<b>You got a better way?</b>

0:12:31.584 --> 0:12:33.294
<b>Face-to-face
works pretty good.</b>

0:12:33.377 --> 0:12:36.505
<b>This place ain't exactly
the romantic spot.</b>

0:12:36.589 --> 0:12:38.924
<b>I'm gonna have her get
on the Staten Island Ferry.</b>

0:12:39.008 --> 0:12:41.552
<b>Then, once she can see
the Empire State Building,</b>

0:12:41.635 --> 0:12:42.928
<b>she opens the letter...</b>

0:12:43.012 --> 0:12:45.097
<b>It's like almost being there.</b>

0:12:45.181 --> 0:12:46.891
<b>Except for the fact
that I won't be there.</b>

0:12:48.225 --> 0:12:49.143
<b>Try "passion."</b>

0:12:49.226 --> 0:12:51.103
<b>Ooh! Ooh! "Passion."
"Passion." That's dope.</b>

0:12:51.854 --> 0:12:53.022
<b>Passion.</b>

0:12:54.690 --> 0:12:55.775
<b>How do you spell that?</b>

0:12:55.858 --> 0:12:57.610
<b>-Is it P-A-S-H?
-Uh-uh.</b>

0:12:59.403 --> 0:13:00.404
<b>No "H"?</b>

0:13:06.827 --> 0:13:08.287
<b>LJ, hold up.</b>

0:13:08.370 --> 0:13:09.955
<b>Hold up.</b>

0:13:10.039 --> 0:13:12.041
<b>I don't think I can
go through with this.</b>

0:13:12.124 --> 0:13:13.542
<b>Everything's going
to be fine.</b>

0:13:14.543 --> 0:13:15.753
<b>Trust me.</b>

0:13:25.930 --> 0:13:27.139
<b>We understand
each other, then?</b>

0:13:27.223 --> 0:13:28.224
<b>-Yeah.
-Friday.</b>

0:13:28.307 --> 0:13:30.559
<b>Not Saturday.
Not Sunday. Friday.</b>

0:13:30.643 --> 0:13:32.144
<b>It's totally understood.</b>

0:13:32.228 --> 0:13:33.896
<b>I don't want hundreds,
I don't want fives, I don't want ones.</b>

0:13:33.979 --> 0:13:34.897
<b>I know, I know.</b>

0:13:34.980 --> 0:13:36.148
<b>Tens and 20s only.</b>

0:13:45.783 --> 0:13:47.535
<b>It's on.</b>

0:14:00.381 --> 0:14:01.674
<b>Police!</b>

0:14:24.822 --> 0:14:27.283
<b>Abruzzi, I need you
to hire me a P.I.</b>

0:14:29.326 --> 0:14:31.078
<b>Beat it.</b>

0:14:31.161 --> 0:14:32.997
<b>Maybe you ought to hear
what I got to say.</b>

0:14:33.080 --> 0:14:34.540
<b>You got nothing I need.</b>

0:14:37.167 --> 0:14:38.544
<b>Wouldn't be
too sure of that.</b>

0:14:39.837 --> 0:14:41.171
<b>My mistake.</b>

0:14:42.131 --> 0:14:45.092
<b>Just what I need... a duck.</b>

0:14:46.051 --> 0:14:47.428
<b>P.I., Abruzzi.</b>

0:14:47.511 --> 0:14:50.139
<b>You might find I can be
of more assistance than you think.</b>

0:14:53.100 --> 0:14:54.310
<b>Mull it over.</b>

0:14:55.561 --> 0:14:57.271
<b>Come find me
when you're ready to talk.</b>

0:15:04.778 --> 0:15:06.780
<b>All right, guys,
pick it up!</b>

0:15:06.864 --> 0:15:08.324
<b>I want to get home tonight!</b>

0:15:08.616 --> 0:15:09.700
<b>Maggio.</b>

0:15:16.874 --> 0:15:18.042
<b>Yeah? So?</b>

0:15:18.125 --> 0:15:19.752
<b>That's the son of a bitch
that fingered Abruzzi.</b>

0:15:21.003 --> 0:15:22.171
<b>That's Fibonacci?</b>

0:15:23.505 --> 0:15:25.716
<b>I thought the punk
was gone forever.</b>

0:15:25.799 --> 0:15:27.718
<b>Evidently,
somebody found him.</b>

0:15:27.801 --> 0:15:29.803
<b>Somebody messing with us?</b>

0:15:29.887 --> 0:15:31.430
<b>This you're not
going to believe.</b>

0:15:35.392 --> 0:15:36.477
<b>What is it?</b>

0:15:41.482 --> 0:15:43.817
<b>Tattoo looks fresh.
Hold that.</b>

0:15:45.235 --> 0:15:47.571
<b>I guess, being a diabetic,
you don't mind needles.</b>

0:15:48.280 --> 0:15:49.990
<b>I'm Michael, by the way.</b>

0:15:50.074 --> 0:15:51.784
<b>Scofield.
I read your report.</b>

0:15:52.576 --> 0:15:53.994
<b>And you are?</b>

0:15:54.078 --> 0:15:55.871
<b>Dr. Tancredi will do.</b>

0:15:55.955 --> 0:15:57.331
<b>"Tancredi" like the governor?</b>

0:15:59.416 --> 0:16:00.793
<b>You're not related,
are you?</b>

0:16:02.378 --> 0:16:04.838
<b>Hmm. Wouldn't think
you'd find the daughter</b>

0:16:04.922 --> 0:16:07.424
<b>of Frontier Justice Frank
working in a prison.</b>

0:16:08.175 --> 0:16:10.177
<b>As a doctor, no less.</b>

0:16:10.260 --> 0:16:13.305
<b>I believe in being part
of the solution, not the problem.</b>

0:16:13.389 --> 0:16:17.601
<b>Hmm. "Be the change you want
to see in the world."</b>

0:16:21.563 --> 0:16:22.439
<b>What?</b>

0:16:24.191 --> 0:16:26.110
<b>Nothing. That was just
my senior quote.</b>

0:16:26.652 --> 0:16:27.653
<b>That was you?</b>

0:16:27.736 --> 0:16:29.697
<b>This whole time,
I was thinking it was Gandhi.</b>

0:16:29.780 --> 0:16:32.366
<b>You're very funny.</b>

0:16:32.449 --> 0:16:34.493
<b>Sit tight.
Put direct pressure on that.</b>

0:16:34.576 --> 0:16:35.619
<b>I'll be back
in a sec.</b>

0:16:50.801 --> 0:16:51.885
<b>So, how do we play this?</b>

0:16:51.969 --> 0:16:54.096
<b>You hook me up
with a few weeks' supply?</b>

0:16:54.179 --> 0:16:56.724
<b>Nice try.
No hypos on the floor.</b>

0:16:56.807 --> 0:16:59.852
<b>I'm the farthest thing
from a junkie. Trust me.</b>

0:16:59.935 --> 0:17:01.228
<b>I got news
for you, Michael.</b>

0:17:01.311 --> 0:17:03.564
<b>"Trust me" means absolutely zero
inside these walls.</b>

0:17:03.647 --> 0:17:05.149
<b>The only way
you're getting that insulin</b>

0:17:05.232 --> 0:17:07.276
<b>is if I'm administering it.</b>

0:17:07.359 --> 0:17:09.570
<b>Guess we'll be seeing
a lot of each other, then, huh?</b>

0:17:10.446 --> 0:17:11.447
<b>I guess so.</b>

0:17:24.460 --> 0:17:26.628
<b>We're all clear
on the Burrows execution.</b>

0:17:26.712 --> 0:17:28.338
<b>-Good.
-Except for one thing.</b>

0:17:28.422 --> 0:17:30.632
<b>Bishop McMorrow
is not in the fold.</b>

0:17:33.343 --> 0:17:35.888
<b>He's got a lot of influence
with the governor.</b>

0:17:35.971 --> 0:17:37.806
<b>They went to prep school
together, apparently.</b>

0:17:39.141 --> 0:17:42.102
<b>Look, the closer it gets,
the more I'm worried</b>

0:17:42.186 --> 0:17:44.396
<b>that the bottom is going
to fall out of this whole thing.</b>

0:17:48.859 --> 0:17:51.528
<b>Well, maybe it's time you arranged a visit
with the good bishop, then.</b>

0:17:53.572 --> 0:17:57.743
<b>Look, in one month,
it'll all be over.</b>

0:17:57.826 --> 0:18:02.206
<b>"The Son of Man must be delivered
into the hands of sinful men</b>

0:18:02.289 --> 0:18:06.168
<b>and be crucified
and the third day, rise again."</b>

0:18:06.251 --> 0:18:10.047
<b>And they remembered His words,
and so should you.</b>

0:18:10.130 --> 0:18:12.299
<b>Good day, gentlemen.
May God be with you.</b>

0:18:17.554 --> 0:18:19.389
<b>Let's go,
let's go, let's go.</b>

0:18:24.812 --> 0:18:26.063
<b>Michael.</b>

0:18:28.690 --> 0:18:30.818
<b>Let's go. Come on, man.
Keep moving.</b>

0:18:30.901 --> 0:18:32.236
<b>Keep moving.
Move. Come on.</b>

0:18:32.319 --> 0:18:34.154
<b>- Why?
- Let's go, man. Come on.</b>

0:18:34.238 --> 0:18:36.156
<b>I'm getting you
out of here.</b>

0:18:36.240 --> 0:18:38.408
<b>Burrows, roll it up.
Happy hour's over.</b>

0:18:39.743 --> 0:18:40.994
<b>It's impossible.</b>

0:18:41.078 --> 0:18:42.663
<b>Not if you designed
the place, it isn't.</b>

0:18:51.588 --> 0:18:52.589
<b>Too formal.</b>

0:18:55.592 --> 0:18:57.177
<b>Too "greeting card."</b>

0:18:57.261 --> 0:18:58.679
<b>Well, we got
to make a decision</b>

0:18:58.762 --> 0:19:00.347
<b>sooner or later,
you know.</b>

0:19:00.430 --> 0:19:01.306
<b>We have time.</b>

0:19:01.390 --> 0:19:04.268
<b>We don't, actually.</b>

0:19:04.351 --> 0:19:07.771
<b>I mean, at some point,
we got to pull the trigger on this thing.</b>

0:19:07.855 --> 0:19:09.356
<b>I don't want
to rush this.</b>

0:19:09.439 --> 0:19:10.649
<b>We're only going
to do it once.</b>

0:19:10.732 --> 0:19:11.733
<b>We have to
get it right.</b>

0:19:17.406 --> 0:19:20.284
<b>Honey, can I
ask you something?</b>

0:19:20.367 --> 0:19:21.285
<b>Of course.</b>

0:19:22.286 --> 0:19:23.704
<b>Are you putting this off?</b>

0:19:23.787 --> 0:19:25.038
<b>What do you mean?</b>

0:19:25.122 --> 0:19:27.040
<b>I mean, are you
having second thoughts?</b>

0:19:27.666 --> 0:19:30.085
<b>No. Honey, no.</b>

0:19:30.711 --> 0:19:31.670
<b>I'm not.</b>

0:19:32.504 --> 0:19:33.714
<b>I don't know.</b>

0:19:33.797 --> 0:19:36.133
<b>-I just can't help thinking this is about--
-It's not.</b>

0:19:37.968 --> 0:19:39.136
<b>I love you.</b>

0:19:40.137 --> 0:19:41.722
<b>And I want
to be your wife.</b>

0:19:45.976 --> 0:19:47.144
<b>Passion?</b>

0:19:47.227 --> 0:19:48.228
<b>What were you thinking?</b>

0:19:48.312 --> 0:19:49.396
<b>Hey, you went for it.</b>

0:19:49.479 --> 0:19:51.565
<b>She probably thinks
I went sissy up in here.</b>

0:19:51.648 --> 0:19:56.111
<b>"Passion." You know,
got more than one syllable, too much talkin'.</b>

0:19:56.195 --> 0:19:58.322
<b>That's me from now on.
One-syllable Sucre.</b>

0:19:58.405 --> 0:20:00.574
<b>Yes. No. Love.</b>

0:20:00.657 --> 0:20:02.075
<b>Hate. Love.</b>

0:20:02.159 --> 0:20:03.410
<b>Give it time.</b>

0:20:03.493 --> 0:20:04.745
<b>Are you kidding?</b>

0:20:04.828 --> 0:20:06.121
<b>I proposed to her.</b>

0:20:06.205 --> 0:20:07.581
<b>That doesn't take time.</b>

0:20:07.664 --> 0:20:08.916
<b>Si or no.</b>

0:20:08.999 --> 0:20:10.083
<b>One syllable, man.</b>

0:20:13.503 --> 0:20:14.504
<b>She's supposed
to come around</b>

0:20:14.588 --> 0:20:16.173
<b>for a conjugal on Tuesday.</b>

0:20:16.256 --> 0:20:17.633
<b>She's always
calling me beforehand,</b>

0:20:17.716 --> 0:20:19.718
<b>letting me know
she's coming.</b>

0:20:19.801 --> 0:20:22.346
<b>This time, man,
I ain't heard a peep.</b>

0:20:23.639 --> 0:20:24.848
<b>You spooked her.</b>

0:20:25.849 --> 0:20:26.934
<b>Scofield.</b>

0:20:27.017 --> 0:20:29.228
<b>Get it together.
Pope wants to see you.</b>

0:20:33.523 --> 0:20:35.025
<b>No good, Fish.</b>

0:20:35.108 --> 0:20:37.152
<b>No one gets an audience
with the Pope.</b>

0:20:37.236 --> 0:20:39.988
<b>Not unless he's real interested
in what you got going on.</b>

0:20:41.198 --> 0:20:43.408
<b>Top of your class at Loyola.</b>

0:20:43.492 --> 0:20:46.453
<b>Magna cum laude, in fact.</b>

0:20:46.536 --> 0:20:49.373
<b>I can't help wondering
what someone with your credentials</b>

0:20:49.456 --> 0:20:51.041
<b>is doing in a place like this.</b>

0:20:52.376 --> 0:20:55.128
<b>Took a wrong turn
a few months back, I guess.</b>

0:20:55.212 --> 0:20:57.256
<b>You make it sound
like a traffic infraction.</b>

0:20:57.339 --> 0:21:00.509
<b>Like all you did was turn the wrong way
up a one-way street.</b>

0:21:00.592 --> 0:21:02.719
<b>Everyone turns up one
sooner or later.</b>

0:21:05.931 --> 0:21:08.642
<b>The reason
I called you here...</b>

0:21:08.725 --> 0:21:11.645
<b>I noticed in your I-file,
under occupation,</b>

0:21:11.728 --> 0:21:13.772
<b>you put down "unemployed."</b>

0:21:14.523 --> 0:21:15.983
<b>That's not true, now, is it?</b>

0:21:19.111 --> 0:21:22.322
<b>I know you're
a structural engineer, Scofield.</b>

0:21:25.534 --> 0:21:28.078
<b>Shah Jahan
built the Taj Majal</b>

0:21:28.161 --> 0:21:31.832
<b>as a monument
to his undying love for his wife.</b>

0:21:31.915 --> 0:21:34.668
<b>My wife is quite fond
of the story.</b>

0:21:34.751 --> 0:21:36.753
<b>It appeals
to the romantic in her.</b>

0:21:38.964 --> 0:21:42.676
<b>Being married to someone
in Corrections, terrible job.</b>

0:21:42.759 --> 0:21:44.219
<b>Wouldn't wish it on anyone.</b>

0:21:44.761 --> 0:21:47.097
<b>And yet, in 39 years,</b>

0:21:47.180 --> 0:21:49.808
<b>my wife
has never complained.</b>

0:21:49.891 --> 0:21:52.227
<b>And the worst part of it is,
I've never thanked her.</b>

0:21:54.730 --> 0:21:57.149
<b>So, because
I couldn't say it,</b>

0:21:57.232 --> 0:21:59.318
<b>I thought, you know,
I could build it.</b>

0:22:00.819 --> 0:22:03.405
<b>Come June,
it's our 40th anniversary.</b>

0:22:05.741 --> 0:22:07.534
<b>But here, look.</b>

0:22:07.617 --> 0:22:08.994
<b>You see,
the problem is,</b>

0:22:09.536 --> 0:22:11.079
<b>I build anymore,</b>

0:22:11.163 --> 0:22:14.207
<b>it's all gonna come down
like a house of cards.</b>

0:22:14.291 --> 0:22:17.377
<b>That's where I was hoping
you could be of assistance.</b>

0:22:17.461 --> 0:22:18.837
<b>For the favor,
I can offer you</b>

0:22:18.920 --> 0:22:21.631
<b>three days of work
a week in here.</b>

0:22:21.715 --> 0:22:23.675
<b>And it'll keep you
off the yard.</b>

0:22:26.595 --> 0:22:27.846
<b>Mmm.</b>

0:22:30.766 --> 0:22:31.975
<b>I can't do it.</b>

0:22:33.977 --> 0:22:37.397
<b>Son, it's better for me
to owe you one in here</b>

0:22:37.481 --> 0:22:38.774
<b>than it is for you
to owe me one,</b>

0:22:38.857 --> 0:22:40.317
<b>I can promise you that.</b>

0:22:40.984 --> 0:22:42.319
<b>I'll take my chances.</b>

0:22:45.447 --> 0:22:46.782
<b>Then we're through here.</b>

0:22:47.991 --> 0:22:49.117
<b>Guard!</b>

0:22:51.953 --> 0:22:54.247
<b>Two pounds of pot?</b>

0:22:54.331 --> 0:22:55.957
<b>What were you trying to do,
set a record?</b>

0:22:56.625 --> 0:22:58.043
<b>It's not funny, LJ.</b>

0:22:58.126 --> 0:22:59.669
<b>You could be going
to jail.</b>

0:23:01.129 --> 0:23:03.673
<b>It's pretty obvious to me
you need some guidance.</b>

0:23:05.884 --> 0:23:06.802
<b>Hey.</b>

0:23:07.677 --> 0:23:08.678
<b>Thanks.</b>

0:23:11.181 --> 0:23:12.349
<b>From who,
old Daddy Warbucks?</b>

0:23:12.432 --> 0:23:14.309
<b>Give him a chance.
He's a good man.</b>

0:23:14.393 --> 0:23:16.311
<b>We got nothing in common.</b>

0:23:16.395 --> 0:23:18.688
<b>Come on. Where is this
coming from, LJ?</b>

0:23:18.772 --> 0:23:21.650
<b>Last semester you were getting
almost all A's and now...</b>

0:23:25.320 --> 0:23:26.905
<b>It's your father, isn't it?</b>

0:23:26.988 --> 0:23:28.198
<b>I don't have a father.</b>

0:23:28.281 --> 0:23:30.200
<b>It wasn't an immaculate
conception, honey.</b>

0:23:30.283 --> 0:23:31.493
<b>Trust me.</b>

0:23:34.579 --> 0:23:36.373
<b>Maybe it's time
we went and saw him.</b>

0:23:37.707 --> 0:23:38.667
<b>Mom...</b>

0:23:39.084 --> 0:23:39.960
<b>Mom.</b>

0:23:40.836 --> 0:23:41.795
<b>Don't.</b>

0:23:41.878 --> 0:23:43.255
<b>I'm about as excited
by the prospect as you are,</b>

0:23:43.338 --> 0:23:45.006
<b>but something's gotta give.</b>

0:23:45.090 --> 0:23:46.425
<b>You have got
too much potential</b>

0:23:46.508 --> 0:23:48.385
<b>to be screwing up
your life like this.</b>

0:23:52.389 --> 0:23:56.435
<b>What if they'd sent you
to Taylorville or Marion and not here?</b>

0:23:56.518 --> 0:23:59.020
<b>I think I'd be doing
the same thing I'm doing in here.</b>

0:23:59.104 --> 0:24:01.273
<b>Eating Jell-O,
drinking Kool-Aid...</b>

0:24:01.356 --> 0:24:03.024
<b>I know what you're doing.</b>

0:24:03.108 --> 0:24:05.652
<b>It's not the luck of the draw
that you're in here with Lincoln.</b>

0:24:06.903 --> 0:24:08.029
<b>You forget I know you.</b>

0:24:08.113 --> 0:24:09.531
<b>Both of you.</b>

0:24:09.614 --> 0:24:12.826
<b>You two have the most
dysfunctional idea of love I've ever seen.</b>

0:24:12.909 --> 0:24:15.454
<b>What, he beats you up
to keep you off the streets,</b>

0:24:15.537 --> 0:24:17.831
<b>so you get yourself tossed
into Fox River with him?</b>

0:24:18.540 --> 0:24:19.666
<b>To what?</b>

0:24:19.749 --> 0:24:20.834
<b>Save him?</b>

0:24:23.170 --> 0:24:24.171
<b>I deserve to know.</b>

0:24:24.254 --> 0:24:26.131
<b>I loved him
as much as you did.</b>

0:24:26.214 --> 0:24:29.468
<b>Past tense for you, maybe.
Not me.</b>

0:24:29.551 --> 0:24:32.596
<b>I gave him a shot
when I got back from college. I did.</b>

0:24:32.679 --> 0:24:34.347
<b>Even with all the stuff
that was going on with him,</b>

0:24:34.431 --> 0:24:36.141
<b>I did everything I could
to make it work.</b>

0:24:36.224 --> 0:24:37.434
<b>And he threw it away.</b>

0:24:37.517 --> 0:24:39.144
<b>You ever think maybe he was hurt
that you left</b>

0:24:39.227 --> 0:24:40.353
<b>in the first place?</b>

0:24:41.396 --> 0:24:42.939
<b>Don't do this.</b>

0:24:43.023 --> 0:24:44.816
<b>Whatever it is you're doing,
don't do it.</b>

0:24:44.900 --> 0:24:45.859
<b>There's a better way.</b>

0:24:45.942 --> 0:24:47.110
<b>I'm already appealing
your case.</b>

0:24:47.194 --> 0:24:48.945
<b>I told you
to leave that alone.</b>

0:24:49.029 --> 0:24:50.780
<b>I've gotten in touch with the diocese about Lincoln.
The bishop may be able to help.</b>

0:24:50.864 --> 0:24:53.074
<b>That won't stop it.
It'll only delay it.</b>

0:24:57.245 --> 0:24:59.498
<b>You want
to do something?</b>

0:24:59.581 --> 0:25:01.333
<b>You find out
who's trying to bury him.</b>

0:25:04.294 --> 0:25:06.338
<b>Nobody's trying to bury him.</b>

0:25:06.421 --> 0:25:08.048
<b>The evidence was there.</b>

0:25:08.131 --> 0:25:09.591
<b>The evidence was cooked.</b>

0:25:12.385 --> 0:25:14.930
<b>Visiting hours
are now over.</b>

0:25:19.768 --> 0:25:21.353
<b>Take care of yourself.</b>

0:25:23.271 --> 0:25:25.482
<b>Someone wants him
dead, Veronica.</b>

0:25:25.565 --> 0:25:27.567
<b>Something more
is going on here.</b>

0:25:28.401 --> 0:25:29.611
<b>This is desperation, Michael.</b>

0:25:29.694 --> 0:25:31.738
<b>You're grabbing at straws.
You're in denial.</b>

0:25:31.821 --> 0:25:32.656
<b>Maybe.</b>

0:25:32.739 --> 0:25:33.990
<b>But I can't watch him die.</b>

0:25:34.783 --> 0:25:35.742
<b>I won't do that.</b>

0:26:05.981 --> 0:26:07.232
<b>Gentlemen...</b>

0:26:07.315 --> 0:26:10.151
<b>What is it about the Burrows situation
that I can help you with?</b>

0:26:10.235 --> 0:26:13.154
<b>It's our understanding
that you have great influence with the governor.</b>

0:26:13.238 --> 0:26:17.742
<b>I wouldn't say it's "great" or "influence."</b>

0:26:17.826 --> 0:26:19.077
<b>We're friends.</b>

0:26:19.160 --> 0:26:22.038
<b>It's also our understanding
that you oppose the death penalty.</b>

0:26:22.122 --> 0:26:23.873
<b>I'm a man of God.
How could I not?</b>

0:26:23.957 --> 0:26:27.168
<b>In this case, we're hoping
you'll suspend that position.</b>

0:26:27.252 --> 0:26:28.878
<b>At least temporarily.</b>

0:26:28.962 --> 0:26:32.966
<b>If the inmate appeals
to me for intervention,</b>

0:26:33.049 --> 0:26:34.509
<b>how can I
turn my back on him?</b>

0:26:34.593 --> 0:26:37.554
<b>You have a habit of answering
a question with a question.</b>

0:26:37.637 --> 0:26:40.932
<b>And you have a way of asking questions
that beg more questions.</b>

0:26:45.645 --> 0:26:47.147
<b>Are you saying
you won't do it?</b>

0:26:47.230 --> 0:26:48.898
<b>I'm not a man to equivocate.</b>

0:26:52.736 --> 0:26:55.822
<b>You're, what, 62 years old now,
Your Excellency.</b>

0:26:55.905 --> 0:26:56.823
<b>That's right.</b>

0:26:56.906 --> 0:26:58.283
<b>I would assume, then,
that you'd be well-versed</b>

0:26:58.366 --> 0:27:00.285
<b>in how our government's
tax system works.</b>

0:27:00.368 --> 0:27:02.037
<b>Taking personal
capital gains</b>

0:27:02.120 --> 0:27:04.247
<b>under the church's
tax shelter...</b>

0:27:04.331 --> 0:27:06.374
<b>that would be fraud,
wouldn't it, Your Excellency?</b>

0:27:07.626 --> 0:27:11.463
<b>I will not be cowed
into forsaking my beliefs.</b>

0:27:12.130 --> 0:27:13.923
<b>Not by you or anyone else.</b>

0:27:15.175 --> 0:27:16.468
<b>Admirable.</b>

0:27:17.344 --> 0:27:18.887
<b>Good day, Excellency.</b>

0:27:19.929 --> 0:27:20.889
<b>Mr. Kellerman...</b>

0:27:22.432 --> 0:27:26.645
<b>What is it about this case
that the Secret Service is so interested in?</b>

0:27:26.728 --> 0:27:28.813
<b>The man killed
the Vice President's brother.</b>

0:27:37.072 --> 0:27:37.947
<b>What'd you say?</b>

0:27:38.031 --> 0:27:39.032
<b>You heard me.</b>

0:27:39.115 --> 0:27:40.700
<b>Someone found Fibonacci.</b>

0:27:40.784 --> 0:27:42.702
<b>I'm looking at the photos
right now.</b>

0:27:42.786 --> 0:27:45.205
<b>Son of a bitch
has got a beard, sunglasses...</b>

0:27:45.288 --> 0:27:46.956
<b>Witness protection,
if I ever saw it.</b>

0:27:47.540 --> 0:27:48.875
<b>Who was this someone?</b>

0:27:48.958 --> 0:27:51.086
<b>Don't know, there's no return address
on the envelope.</b>

0:27:51.920 --> 0:27:54.047
<b>Just...</b>

0:27:54.130 --> 0:27:56.675
<b>this folded-up bird
made of paper.</b>

0:27:59.094 --> 0:28:00.387
<b>Like origami?</b>

0:28:00.470 --> 0:28:01.596
<b>Yeah, like that.</b>

0:28:02.305 --> 0:28:03.598
<b>Like origami.</b>

0:28:37.799 --> 0:28:40.009
<b>You're Charles Westmoreland,
right?</b>

0:28:40.093 --> 0:28:41.136
<b>Do I know you?</b>

0:28:41.219 --> 0:28:43.388
<b>I knew your wife
before she passed.</b>

0:28:43.930 --> 0:28:44.931
<b>You knew Marla?</b>

0:28:45.014 --> 0:28:45.932
<b>You mean Ann?</b>

0:28:46.975 --> 0:28:48.268
<b>How'd you know her?</b>

0:28:48.351 --> 0:28:50.228
<b>We taught together
in Boston.</b>

0:28:50.311 --> 0:28:51.354
<b>East Farmington.</b>

0:28:51.438 --> 0:28:52.647
<b>You mean West Wilmington?</b>

0:28:54.023 --> 0:28:55.316
<b>No more tests.</b>

0:28:55.817 --> 0:28:56.901
<b>I promise.</b>

0:28:58.236 --> 0:28:59.988
<b>Seems you know
everything about me.</b>

0:29:00.697 --> 0:29:01.531
<b>Who are you?</b>

0:29:01.614 --> 0:29:02.490
<b>Michael Scofield.</b>

0:29:03.324 --> 0:29:05.118
<b>How'd you get it in here?</b>

0:29:05.201 --> 0:29:07.328
<b>First off,
she's not an "it."</b>

0:29:07.412 --> 0:29:09.581
<b>She's Marilyn,
and she's grandfathered</b>

0:29:09.664 --> 0:29:13.835
<b>back from the days
when prisoners were allowed a creature comfort or two.</b>

0:29:14.669 --> 0:29:16.212
<b>I heard
you were D.B. Cooper.</b>

0:29:18.214 --> 0:29:20.091
<b>Every new fish
comes in here,</b>

0:29:20.175 --> 0:29:21.301
<b>first thing they hear,</b>

0:29:21.384 --> 0:29:24.262
<b>is that Charles Westmoreland
is D.B. Cooper.</b>

0:29:24.345 --> 0:29:26.139
<b>I'll tell you
like I tell them...</b>

0:29:27.557 --> 0:29:29.434
<b>You want the Cooper story?</b>

0:29:29.517 --> 0:29:32.771
<b>I can't give it to you,
'cause I'm not him.</b>

0:29:32.854 --> 0:29:33.688
<b>It's too bad.</b>

0:29:33.772 --> 0:29:35.523
<b>Sort of wish it was true.</b>

0:29:35.607 --> 0:29:36.941
<b>The man's a legend.</b>

0:29:37.025 --> 0:29:39.944
<b>Nowhere near as much
as I wish it were true, friend.</b>

0:29:40.028 --> 0:29:42.864
<b>I'd have a million-five
waiting for me on the outside.</b>

0:29:45.867 --> 0:29:48.203
<b>I'd put some grass
under 'em if I were you.</b>

0:29:49.579 --> 0:29:52.207
<b>This thing would go
a whole lot easier if you'd just hire me.</b>

0:29:53.208 --> 0:29:54.751
<b>What is this all about?</b>

0:29:55.835 --> 0:29:57.837
<b>Say you were able
to get outside those walls...</b>

0:29:58.755 --> 0:29:59.839
<b>would you have
the people in place</b>

0:29:59.923 --> 0:30:01.966
<b>to make sure
you disappeared forever?</b>

0:30:02.050 --> 0:30:03.009
<b>What do you care?</b>

0:30:03.468 --> 0:30:04.969
<b>Just curious.</b>

0:30:05.053 --> 0:30:06.638
<b>Where's Fibonacci?</b>

0:30:06.721 --> 0:30:08.223
<b>That's not the way
it works.</b>

0:30:12.936 --> 0:30:15.897
<b>They come at me, John,
I'm coming after you.</b>

0:30:17.106 --> 0:30:18.107
<b>I doubt it.</b>

0:30:20.527 --> 0:30:22.111
<b>Fight, fight, fight...</b>

0:30:45.426 --> 0:30:46.928
<b>All right.</b>

0:30:53.142 --> 0:30:54.310
<b>Get on the ground.</b>

0:30:56.938 --> 0:30:58.940
<b>I totally
misjudged you, Scofield.</b>

0:30:59.023 --> 0:31:01.401
<b>I didn't think
you were the agitating type.</b>

0:31:01.484 --> 0:31:04.404
<b>Behavior like that
will not be tolerated in my prison.</b>

0:31:04.487 --> 0:31:05.613
<b>Ninety days in the SHU!</b>

0:31:05.697 --> 0:31:07.699
<b>That ought to be enough time
to convince you of that fact.</b>

0:31:07.782 --> 0:31:08.616
<b>Ninety days?</b>

0:31:08.700 --> 0:31:09.576
<b>That's right.</b>

0:31:17.792 --> 0:31:19.294
<b>Something you want to say?</b>

0:31:20.003 --> 0:31:22.046
<b>It's just...</b>

0:31:22.130 --> 0:31:23.756
<b>I'm not of much value
to you in the SHU.</b>

0:31:24.424 --> 0:31:25.258
<b>Value?</b>

0:31:25.341 --> 0:31:27.385
<b>Hmm... The Taj.</b>

0:31:27.468 --> 0:31:29.470
<b>It'd be a shame
for the eighth wonder of the modern world</b>

0:31:29.554 --> 0:31:32.682
<b>to collapse because the stress
isn't properly propagated.</b>

0:31:32.765 --> 0:31:33.850
<b>Properly propagated?</b>

0:31:33.933 --> 0:31:35.643
<b>Properly propagated.</b>

0:31:35.727 --> 0:31:37.270
<b>The joints are overloaded.</b>

0:31:37.353 --> 0:31:39.647
<b>They won't provide anywhere
near the sheer strength</b>

0:31:39.731 --> 0:31:41.149
<b>the completed structure
will need.</b>

0:31:42.817 --> 0:31:44.319
<b>How much work
are we talking?</b>

0:31:45.028 --> 0:31:46.362
<b>You want it by when, June?</b>

0:31:46.446 --> 0:31:47.488
<b>Yes.</b>

0:31:47.572 --> 0:31:50.158
<b>Then we'd better get started,
wouldn't you say?</b>

0:32:17.393 --> 0:32:18.436
<b>Who's there?</b>

0:32:36.871 --> 0:32:38.831
<b>Bishop McMorrow
was killed last night.</b>

0:32:38.915 --> 0:32:40.541
<b>Someone shot him
while he was sleeping.</b>

0:32:41.876 --> 0:32:43.252
<b>I thought
you'd want to know.</b>

0:32:43.920 --> 0:32:44.796
<b>Thanks.</b>

0:32:52.553 --> 0:32:53.680
<b>Michael was right.</b>

0:33:23.543 --> 0:33:25.128
<b>Sink, you got a visitor.</b>

0:33:37.974 --> 0:33:39.392
<b>He was arrested.</b>

0:33:40.977 --> 0:33:42.186
<b>For what?</b>

0:33:42.270 --> 0:33:43.688
<b>Possession of marijuana.</b>

0:33:46.816 --> 0:33:50.111
<b>I figured he could use
some fatherly advice before it's...</b>

0:33:51.404 --> 0:33:53.614
<b>-Gone forever?
-I didn't mean that.</b>

0:33:53.698 --> 0:33:55.033
<b>I know you didn't.</b>

0:33:55.116 --> 0:33:56.200
<b>Thanks, Lisa.</b>

0:33:57.952 --> 0:33:59.120
<b>Sit down.</b>

0:34:04.292 --> 0:34:05.126
<b>Dope, huh?</b>

0:34:05.793 --> 0:34:07.003
<b>Using or dealing?</b>

0:34:08.629 --> 0:34:09.881
<b>What's the difference?</b>

0:34:09.964 --> 0:34:13.301
<b>Then what, you, uh, think it gives you
some kind of street cred?</b>

0:34:15.303 --> 0:34:16.554
<b>You got a piece
of the good life.</b>

0:34:16.637 --> 0:34:17.638
<b>Take advantage.</b>

0:34:18.973 --> 0:34:20.475
<b>Look, I get it.</b>

0:34:20.558 --> 0:34:22.143
<b>The whole thing.</b>

0:34:22.226 --> 0:34:24.145
<b>She drags me in here,</b>

0:34:24.228 --> 0:34:25.605
<b>you give me a big speech,</b>

0:34:25.688 --> 0:34:27.690
<b>I walk away a changed man.</b>

0:34:27.774 --> 0:34:29.025
<b>Straight A's.</b>

0:34:29.108 --> 0:34:31.944
<b>Harvard.
Grow up and be a dentist.</b>

0:34:32.028 --> 0:34:33.279
<b>It's better than being here.</b>

0:34:35.865 --> 0:34:37.075
<b>You got to realize
who's getting punished</b>

0:34:37.158 --> 0:34:38.910
<b>when you're doing
the things you're doing.</b>

0:34:38.993 --> 0:34:40.745
<b>You think it's me.
It's you.</b>

0:34:40.828 --> 0:34:42.205
<b>I did the same thing.</b>

0:34:42.288 --> 0:34:43.748
<b>Punished the old man
'cause he was gone.</b>

0:34:43.831 --> 0:34:44.749
<b>Look what it got me.</b>

0:34:49.003 --> 0:34:51.380
<b>I'm not asking you
to love me.</b>

0:34:51.464 --> 0:34:54.383
<b>I already screwed up
that chance long ago.</b>

0:34:54.467 --> 0:34:56.677
<b>I'm asking you
to love yourself.</b>

0:34:56.761 --> 0:34:58.679
<b>You can still put the brakes
on this thing.</b>

0:35:01.057 --> 0:35:03.017
<b>So, that's what
fatherly advice is like.</b>

0:35:04.477 --> 0:35:05.520
<b>Where are you going?</b>

0:35:06.729 --> 0:35:08.064
<b>I got homework.</b>

0:35:09.023 --> 0:35:11.067
<b>They're putting me
to death, LJ.</b>

0:35:11.150 --> 0:35:12.735
<b>In a month's time,
I'll be dead.</b>

0:35:13.861 --> 0:35:14.737
<b>You get that?</b>

0:35:15.822 --> 0:35:18.199
<b>You're already
dead to me.</b>

0:35:43.975 --> 0:35:45.518
<b>Yes.</b>

0:35:45.601 --> 0:35:48.521
<b>What? You mean "yes," yes?</b>

0:35:48.604 --> 0:35:49.647
<b>Yes!</b>

0:35:49.730 --> 0:35:51.023
<b>- Yeah!
- Yes!</b>

0:35:53.484 --> 0:35:55.570
<b>-Oh, there's just one thing.
-Of course.</b>

0:35:55.653 --> 0:35:57.029
<b>Mama wants us to wait
till you get out.</b>

0:35:57.113 --> 0:35:58.197
<b>Of course, mi amor.</b>

0:35:58.281 --> 0:35:59.490
<b>Oh, and we have
to get married in a church.</b>

0:35:59.574 --> 0:36:01.659
<b>-Okay. Esta bien.
-A Catholic church.</b>

0:36:01.742 --> 0:36:03.953
<b>Wouldn't want to mess
with the Catholic roots, would we?</b>

0:36:10.751 --> 0:36:11.836
<b>You went to Loyola.</b>

0:36:11.919 --> 0:36:13.337
<b>You've been
checking up on me.</b>

0:36:13.421 --> 0:36:15.256
<b>I like to get to know
my patients.</b>

0:36:15.339 --> 0:36:17.341
<b>I went to Northwestern.
Graduated two years after you did.</b>

0:36:17.425 --> 0:36:19.969
<b>Maybe we met before,
you know, drunk,</b>

0:36:20.052 --> 0:36:21.429
<b>out at a bar somewhere.</b>

0:36:21.512 --> 0:36:22.597
<b>I would have remembered.</b>

0:36:22.680 --> 0:36:24.265
<b>-That a compliment?
-No.</b>

0:36:25.725 --> 0:36:26.601
<b>Hmm.</b>

0:36:27.894 --> 0:36:29.020
<b>What?</b>

0:36:29.103 --> 0:36:31.772
<b>Your blood glucose is at
50 milligrams per deciliter.</b>

0:36:31.856 --> 0:36:33.900
<b>-So?
-That's hypoglycemic.</b>

0:36:33.983 --> 0:36:35.526
<b>Your body's reacting
to the insulin</b>

0:36:35.610 --> 0:36:36.694
<b>like you're not a diabetic.</b>

0:36:36.777 --> 0:36:38.779
<b>You're sure it's type 1 diabetes
you've got?</b>

0:36:38.863 --> 0:36:40.156
<b>Ever since I was a kid.</b>

0:36:41.449 --> 0:36:42.533
<b>All right.</b>

0:36:42.617 --> 0:36:44.368
<b>Not experiencing
any tingling sensation, cold sweats--</b>

0:36:48.873 --> 0:36:50.124
<b>Infirmary.</b>

0:36:50.374 --> 0:36:51.417
<b>Yes.</b>

0:36:52.752 --> 0:36:54.420
<b>Yeah. I did.</b>

0:36:55.796 --> 0:36:58.633
<b>No, I did and I do.
I need them.</b>

0:36:58.716 --> 0:37:02.386
<b>Okay. Um, great.
Well, I'll call him after lunch, then.</b>

0:37:02.470 --> 0:37:04.347
<b>Thanks.
I'm with a patient. Okay.</b>

0:37:05.556 --> 0:37:07.808
<b>I'd like to run some tests
next time you're in.</b>

0:37:07.892 --> 0:37:11.145
<b>Last thing I want is to be
administering insulin to a man who doesn't need it.</b>

0:37:11.604 --> 0:37:13.064
<b>Yeah, sure.</b>

0:37:13.773 --> 0:37:15.024
<b>Okay.</b>

0:37:21.739 --> 0:37:23.199
<b>How'd you get here,
by the way?</b>

0:37:23.658 --> 0:37:25.159
<b>Oh, you know.</b>

0:37:26.160 --> 0:37:27.745
<b>I don't.
That's why I asked.</b>

0:37:27.828 --> 0:37:30.414
<b>You know. Hector.</b>

0:37:30.498 --> 0:37:31.415
<b>What?</b>

0:37:31.499 --> 0:37:33.125
<b>I didn't have any money
for the bus,</b>

0:37:33.209 --> 0:37:34.585
<b>so he offered me a ride.</b>

0:37:35.044 --> 0:37:36.420
<b>He was really sweet.</b>

0:37:38.339 --> 0:37:39.966
<b>Honey, he's just a friend.</b>

0:37:40.049 --> 0:37:41.050
<b>No, he's not
just a friend.</b>

0:37:41.133 --> 0:37:43.010
<b>I know Hector.
I know men.</b>

0:37:43.094 --> 0:37:44.303
<b>Men and women
can't be friends.</b>

0:37:44.387 --> 0:37:47.139
<b>A guy doesn't drive a girl
500 miles across state lines</b>

0:37:47.223 --> 0:37:48.349
<b>because he wants
to be friends.</b>

0:37:48.432 --> 0:37:50.393
<b>Casanova, wrap it up.</b>

0:37:51.560 --> 0:37:55.147
<b>Hey, you got nothing
to worry about, okay?</b>

0:37:55.231 --> 0:37:57.275
<b>It's you I'm marrying.</b>

0:37:57.358 --> 0:37:59.110
<b>It's not you
I'm worried about.</b>

0:38:01.737 --> 0:38:03.197
<b>Sixteen more months.</b>

0:38:12.039 --> 0:38:13.332
<b>I love you.</b>

0:38:24.969 --> 0:38:27.054
<b>Be easy, son, all right?</b>

0:38:32.935 --> 0:38:35.062
<b>Sucre tells me
you're the local pharmacy.</b>

0:38:39.150 --> 0:38:41.277
<b>-What you need, man?
-PUGNAc.</b>

0:38:41.360 --> 0:38:43.529
<b>I only speak English,
white boy.</b>

0:38:43.612 --> 0:38:44.822
<b>It's an insulin blocker.</b>

0:38:44.905 --> 0:38:46.532
<b>Standard
over-the-counter variety.</b>

0:38:46.615 --> 0:38:47.700
<b>You can get it
at any pharmacy.</b>

0:38:47.783 --> 0:38:49.118
<b>You can get that
at medical then.</b>

0:38:49.201 --> 0:38:50.578
<b>I can't get it at medical.</b>

0:38:51.370 --> 0:38:52.288
<b>Why not?</b>

0:38:52.371 --> 0:38:54.415
<b>Because they're already
giving me insulin shots.</b>

0:38:56.250 --> 0:38:58.836
<b>You're one mixed-up cracker,
you know that?</b>

0:38:58.919 --> 0:39:00.296
<b>Can you get it for me,
or not?</b>

0:39:01.255 --> 0:39:03.215
<b>Only if you tell me
why is it you want</b>

0:39:03.299 --> 0:39:04.508
<b>to keep going
back up to medical</b>

0:39:04.592 --> 0:39:06.510
<b>to get an insulin shot
for which you don't need.</b>

0:39:07.136 --> 0:39:08.721
<b>I like the ambiance.</b>

0:39:08.804 --> 0:39:09.972
<b>Uh-huh.</b>

0:39:10.514 --> 0:39:11.724
<b>Are we in business?</b>

0:39:17.480 --> 0:39:18.731
<b>All personnel,</b>

0:39:18.814 --> 0:39:21.025
<b>Facility Two lockdown

0:39:21.108 --> 0:39:24.070
<b>Facility One lockdown

0:39:27.531 --> 0:39:29.742
<b>Scofield. I don't know
what you did,</b>

0:39:29.825 --> 0:39:32.244
<b>but Abruzzi wanted me
to give you this P.I. card.</b>

0:39:32.995 --> 0:39:33.954
<b>Congratulations.</b>

0:39:34.038 --> 0:39:36.082
<b>You just joined the ranks
of the employed.</b>

0:39:52.556 --> 0:39:54.016
<b>Kudos, Fish.</b>

0:39:54.600 --> 0:39:56.018
<b>You got spine.</b>

0:40:01.857 --> 0:40:04.026
<b>All right, cons,
break it down!</b>

0:40:06.445 --> 0:40:07.738
<b>Move it, guys.</b>

0:40:20.042 --> 0:40:22.128
<b>Saw Veronica
came by yesterday.</b>

0:40:22.211 --> 0:40:23.337
<b>Still engaged to that guy?</b>

0:40:23.421 --> 0:40:24.296
<b>Yup.</b>

0:40:25.047 --> 0:40:25.965
<b>Could have been me.</b>

0:40:26.048 --> 0:40:27.550
<b>If you hadn't
self-destructed.</b>

0:40:28.926 --> 0:40:30.886
<b>You think I meant
to knock up Lisa Rix?</b>

0:40:31.637 --> 0:40:32.847
<b>I was just being stupid.</b>

0:40:33.097 --> 0:40:34.098
<b>Hurt.</b>

0:40:35.558 --> 0:40:37.101
<b>Shouldn't have
pushed her away, though.</b>

0:40:37.184 --> 0:40:38.310
<b>You pushed everyone away.</b>

0:40:40.062 --> 0:40:41.480
<b>I'm an anchor.</b>

0:40:41.564 --> 0:40:43.274
<b>All I'll do
is drag him down with me.</b>

0:40:48.737 --> 0:40:50.281
<b>Why did you hire him?</b>

0:40:50.364 --> 0:40:51.740
<b>Keep your friends close</b>

0:40:51.824 --> 0:40:53.826
<b>and your enemies closer.</b>

0:40:59.331 --> 0:41:00.583
<b>You mean
what you said earlier?</b>

0:41:00.666 --> 0:41:02.793
<b>I'm not here on vacation,
trust me.</b>

0:41:04.253 --> 0:41:06.755
<b>Getting outside these walls,
that's just the beginning.</b>

0:41:07.423 --> 0:41:08.799
<b>You're going to need money.</b>

0:41:12.261 --> 0:41:13.888
<b>I'll have it.</b>

0:41:13.971 --> 0:41:15.681
<b>And people
on the outside...</b>

0:41:15.764 --> 0:41:17.308
<b>People that can
help you disappear.</b>

0:41:18.142 --> 0:41:19.518
<b>I've already got them.</b>

0:41:20.436 --> 0:41:21.896
<b>They just
don't know it yet.</b>

0:41:27.276 --> 0:41:29.195
<b>Look, whatever you got
going on, fill me in,</b>

0:41:29.278 --> 0:41:30.321
<b>'cause I'm in the dark here.</b>

0:41:32.448 --> 0:41:34.325
<b>Chaparral Associates

<b>to retrofit

<b>Four million dollar contract.</b>

<b>Head partner
couldn't crack it.</b>

<b>So, he subcontracted out,

<b>with a former associate.</b>

0:41:43.667 --> 0:41:46.253
<b>That guy was one

0:41:48.589 --> 0:41:50.090
<b>We basically ghost-wrote

0:41:50.174 --> 0:41:52.885
<b>Crossed the t's, dotted the i's,

<b>You've seen the blueprints.</b>

<b>Better than that.</b>

0:42:06.565 --> 0:42:07.900
<b>I've got them on me.</b>

0:42:12.321 --> 0:42:13.572
<b>Are you kidding me?</b>

<b>Am I supposed to be seeing

<b>Look closer.</b>

<b>Captioned by Point.360.</b>
