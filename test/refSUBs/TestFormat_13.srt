<i>The Empire is gone, Mando.</i>

2
00:00:04,817 --> 00:00:07,654
<i>This asset
was of extreme importance to me.</i>

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,990
<i><i>I had to ensure its delivery.</i></i>

4
00:00:11,115 --> 00:00:12,909
<i>He's not a local warlord.</i>

5
00:00:12,992 --> 00:00:14,035
<i>He's Imperial.</i>

6
00:00:14,702 --> 00:00:15,703
<i>I'm in.</i>

7
00:00:15,787 --> 00:00:20,041
<i><i>Our secrecy is our survival.
Our survival is our strength.</i></i>

8
00:00:21,543 --> 00:00:23,461
<i><i>Our strength was once in our numbers.</i></i>

9
00:00:23,545 --> 00:00:25,046
<i>Now, we live in the shadows.</i>

10
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,508
<i>Our world was shattered by the Empire.</i>

11
00:00:33,263 --> 00:00:35,598
<i>You're going
to have to relocate the covert.</i>

12
00:00:35,682 --> 00:00:36,891
<i>This is the Way.</i>

13
00:00:36,975 --> 00:00:40,645
<i>In the wake of your destruction,
it was left behind.</i>

14
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,564
<i>Is it still a hunter?</i>

15
00:00:42,647 --> 00:00:44,816
<i>No. But it will protect.</i>

16
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:47,235
<i>You got a real thing for droids,
don't you?</i>

17
00:00:47,777 --> 00:00:49,612
<i>I got a real thing for that droid.</i>

18
00:00:49,696 --> 00:00:51,155
<i>Let me take the child to him...</i>

19
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:52,782
<i>Let's kill him and get out of here.</i>

20
00:00:52,866 --> 00:00:55,535
<i>- We both need the client to be eliminated.
- He's right.</i>

21
00:00:55,618 --> 00:00:58,013
<i>As long as the Imp lives,
he'll send hunters after the child.</i>

22
00:00:58,037 --> 00:00:59,038
<i><i>It's a trap.</i></i>

23
00:00:59,122 --> 00:01:01,833
<i><i>- Have they brought the child?</i>
- Yes, they have.</i>

24
00:01:05,587 --> 00:01:07,630
<i><i>You have something I want.</i></i>

25
00:01:07,964 --> 00:01:09,674
<i>Kuiil? Are you there?</i>

26
00:01:11,718 --> 00:01:12,844
<i>In a few moments...</i>

27
00:01:14,304 --> 00:01:15,889
<i><i>Kuiil! Are you there?</i></i>

28
00:01:16,806 --> 00:01:18,975
<i>It will be mine.</i>

29
00:02:23,665 --> 00:02:26,626
<i>Speeder bikes have arrived
at the checkpoint with the asset.</i>

30
00:02:26,751 --> 00:02:28,920
<i>Awaiting confirmation.</i>

31
00:02:29,337 --> 00:02:30,338
<i>Knock it off!</i>

32
00:02:32,382 --> 00:02:35,009
<i>Waiting for confirmation
to continue into town.</i>

33
00:02:35,093 --> 00:02:37,679
<i><i>That's a go to proceed,
but I advise you to double-check.</i></i>

34
00:02:37,762 --> 00:02:41,808
<i><i>The Moff just touched down and already
took out a squad of local troopers.</i></i>

35
00:02:43,893 --> 00:02:45,186
<i>Standing by.</i>

36
00:02:47,605 --> 00:02:50,650
<i>Did he just say
that Gideon killed his own men?</i>

37
00:02:50,733 --> 00:02:52,902
<i>Oh, who knows?</i>

38
00:02:52,986 --> 00:02:56,322
<i>These guys like to lay down the law
when they first arrive into town.</i>

39
00:02:56,406 --> 00:02:58,241
<i>You know how it is.</i>

40
00:02:58,783 --> 00:03:01,870
<i>I said, shut up. Yeesh.</i>

41
00:03:02,453 --> 00:03:03,913
<i>What is that thing, anyway?</i>

42
00:03:03,997 --> 00:03:04,998
<i>Uh, I don't know.</i>

43
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:07,750
<i>Maybe Moff wants to eat it.
I don't ask questions.</i>

44
00:03:10,003 --> 00:03:11,004
<i>Can I see it?</i>

45
00:03:11,838 --> 00:03:13,840
<i>Did you not just hear
that Moff Gideon killed</i>

46
00:03:13,923 --> 00:03:15,842
<i>a dozen of his own troopers
to make a point.</i>

47
00:03:15,925 --> 00:03:17,927
<i>- Okay.
- I get that point.</i>

48
00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:19,971
<i>- Do you get the point?
- Yes.</i>

49
00:03:20,054 --> 00:03:21,055
<i>Okay.</i>

50
00:03:47,582 --> 00:03:49,375
<i>Should we offer
that thing some water?</i>

51
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:50,835
<i>You just wanna look at it.</i>

52
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,295
<i>So what?
You got to see it!</i>

53
00:03:52,378 --> 00:03:53,379
<i>Barely.</i>

54
00:03:53,463 --> 00:03:56,507
<i>I mean, I grabbed it up off the ground
and I stuffed it in the sack.</i>

55
00:03:57,091 --> 00:03:58,593
<i>It's more than I got to see it.</i>

56
00:03:58,676 --> 00:04:01,804
<i>Look, I'm not taking it out of
this bag until I deliver it to the Moff.</i>

57
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,724
<i>- Fine.
- Okay. Stop asking.</i>

58
00:04:09,646 --> 00:04:12,232
<i>Let me check on this thing. This is crazy.</i>

59
00:04:12,315 --> 00:04:13,358
<i>Any update yet?</i>

60
00:04:13,441 --> 00:04:16,194
<i><i>That's a negative.
Still waiting on confirmation.</i></i>

61
00:04:16,277 --> 00:04:18,088
<i><i>He just killed an officer
for interrupting him,</i></i>

62
00:04:18,112 --> 00:04:20,114
<i><i>- so this might take a while.</i></i>

63
00:04:20,198 --> 00:04:21,824
<i>Thank you.</i>

64
00:04:21,908 --> 00:04:24,452
<i>Standing by still. Unbelievable.</i>

65
00:04:26,037 --> 00:04:28,581
<i>Hey, how long has it been
since that thing moved?</i>

66
00:04:28,665 --> 00:04:31,042
<i>I don't know,
like a minute or two. Don't worry.</i>

67
00:04:31,834 --> 00:04:33,878
<i>Uh, it's been
way longer than a minute.</i>

68
00:04:33,962 --> 00:04:34,963
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

69
00:04:35,046 --> 00:04:37,090
<i>Shouldn't we check
and see if it's still alive?</i>

70
00:04:37,173 --> 00:04:38,466
<i>You hit it pretty hard.</i>

71
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,842
<i>You just wanna see it.</i>

72
00:04:39,926 --> 00:04:41,636
<i>We should check
and see if it's hurt.</i>

73
00:04:41,719 --> 00:04:43,763
<i>The last thing that you want
is to give Gideon a bag</i>

74
00:04:43,846 --> 00:04:45,807
<i>and have him open it
and find whatever is dead...</i>

75
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,559
<i>Okay. Okay, look.
Here you go. See?</i>

76
00:04:47,642 --> 00:04:50,478
<i>Take a peek. Everything's fine.</i>

77
00:04:50,562 --> 00:04:51,563
<i>What is that?</i>

78
00:04:51,855 --> 00:04:53,606
<i>I don't know.
It's a pet or something.</i>

79
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,149

<i>- What about the sewers?
- Sewers?</i>

98
00:06:23,363 --> 00:06:25,740
<i>The Mandalorians
have a covert down in the sewers.</i>

99
00:06:25,823 --> 00:06:28,076

106
00:07:05,488 --> 00:07:06,906

we can get it to float downstream.</i>

340
00:32:18,793 --> 00:32:19,794
<i>Come on.</i>

341
00:32:19,878 --> 00:32:21,629
<i>Looks old. Will it take the heat?</i>

342
00:32:21,713 --> 00:32:23,298
<i>You got a better idea?</i>

343
00:32:23,798 --> 00:32:24,799
<i>Guess not.</i>

344
00:32:28,845 --> 00:32:29,846
<i>Push!</i>

345
00:32:32,181 --> 00:32:33,558
<i>Come on! What're you doing?</i>

346
00:32:33,641 --> 00:32:35,768
<i>- Let's try this.
- Push!</i>

347
00:32:39,272 --> 00:32:41,065
<i>You guys mind getting out of the way?</i>

348
00:32:41,357 --> 00:32:42,358
<i>Oh!</i>

349
00:32:47,864 --> 00:32:48,865
<i>Good job.</i>

350
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:54,704
<i>Watch your feet. It's molten lava.</i>

351
00:32:54,787 --> 00:32:56,039
<i>No kidding.</i>

352
00:33:15,058 --> 00:33:17,560
<i>I don't suppose anybody here speaks droid?</i>

353
00:33:18,353 --> 00:33:20,813
<i>I believe he is asking
where we would like to go.</i>

354
00:33:22,023 --> 00:33:25,235
<i>Down river. To the lava flat.</i>

355
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,348
<i>That's it. We're free!</i>

356
00:34:01,062 --> 00:34:02,188
<i>No.</i>

357
00:34:02,647 --> 00:34:03,773
<i>No, we're not.</i>

358
00:34:03,857 --> 00:34:07,110
<i>Stormtroopers.
They're flanking the mouth of the tunnel.</i>

359
00:34:07,235 --> 00:34:10,196
<i>It looks like an entire platoon.
They must know we're coming.</i>

360
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,656
<i>Stop the boat.</i>

361
00:34:12,073 --> 00:34:14,659
<i>Hey, Droid, I said stop the boat.</i>

362
00:34:16,578 --> 00:34:18,580
<i>Hey! I'm talking to you.</i>

363
00:34:18,663 --> 00:34:19,998
<i>I said stop!</i>

364
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:27,714
<i>We're still moving.</i>

365
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:29,757
<i>Looks like we fight.</i>

366
00:34:29,841 --> 00:34:32,135
<i>- There are too many.
- Then what do you suggest?</i>

367
00:34:32,218 --> 00:34:33,511
<i>'Cause I can't surrender.</i>

368
00:34:33,595 --> 00:34:36,264
<i>They will not be satisfied
with anything less than the child.</i>

369
00:34:36,347 --> 00:34:37,891
<i>This is unacceptable.</i>

370
00:34:37,974 --> 00:34:40,560
<i>I will eliminate the enemy
and you will escape.</i>

371
00:34:40,643 --> 00:34:42,812
<i>You don't have
that kind of firepower, pal.</i>

372
00:34:42,896 --> 00:34:44,480
<i>You wouldn't even get to daylight.</i>

373
00:34:44,564 --> 00:34:45,815
<i>That is not my objective.</i>

374
00:34:46,232 --> 00:34:48,985
<i>We're getting close. Saddle up.</i>

375
00:34:50,695 --> 00:34:53,948
<i>I still have the security protocols
from my manufacturer.</i>

376
00:34:54,032 --> 00:34:57,202
<i>If my designs are compromised,
I must self-destruct.</i>

377
00:34:57,285 --> 00:34:58,828
<i>What're you talking about?</i>

378
00:34:58,912 --> 00:35:01,414
<i>I am not permitted to be captured.
I must be destroyed.</i>

379
00:35:01,539 --> 00:35:03,833
<i>Are we gonna keep talking,
or get out of here?</i>

380
00:35:04,626 --> 00:35:06,377
<i>I can no longer carry this for you.</i>

381
00:35:08,713 --> 00:35:10,048
<i>Nor can I watch over the child.</i>

382
00:35:10,673 --> 00:35:13,051
<i>Wait. You can't self-destruct.</i>

383
00:35:13,134 --> 00:35:14,928
<i>Your base command is to watch the child.</i>

384
00:35:15,011 --> 00:35:17,347
<i>That supersedes
your manufacturer's protocol, right?</i>

385
00:35:18,389 --> 00:35:19,974
<i>- Right?
- This is correct.</i>

386
00:35:20,058 --> 00:35:22,685
<i>Good. Now, grab a blaster
and help us shoot our way out.</i>

387
00:35:22,769 --> 00:35:24,479
<i>Victory through combat
is impossible.</i>

388
00:35:24,562 --> 00:35:27,315
<i>We will be captured.
The child will be lost.</i>

389
00:35:27,398 --> 00:35:31,194
<i>Sadly, there is no scenario where
the child is saved, in which I survive.

<i>Please tell me the child
will be safe in your care.</i>

393

<i>If you do so,
I can default to my secondary command.</i>

<i>But you'll be destroyed.</i>

395

I have never been alive.</i>

<i>Yes, you are. I'm a nurse droid.
I've analyzed your voice.</i>

<i>IG?</i>

401
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,943
<i>What're you doing?</i>

402
00:36:43,641 --> 00:36:47,061
<i>Manufacturer's protocol dictates
I cannot be captured.</i>

403
00:36:49,105 --> 00:36:50,440
<i>I must be destroyed.</i>

00:37:25,642 --> 00:37:26,768
<i>Moff Gideon!</i>

405
00:37:41,366 --> 00:37:43,326
<i>- He missed!
- He won't next time.</i>

406
00:37:43,409 --> 00:37:45,286
<i>Our blasters are useless against him.</i>

<i>Let's make the baby do
the magic hand thing.</i>

00:39:17,212 --> 00:39:18,213
<i>No!</i>

412
00:39:40,151 --> 00:39:43,655
<i>That was impressive, Mando.
Very impressive.</i>

413
00:39:45,073 --> 00:39:47,367
<i>It looks like your Guild rates
have just gone up.</i>

414
00:39:48,409 --> 00:39:49,869
<i>Any more stormtroopers?</i>

415
00:39:49,953 --> 00:39:51,538
<i>I think we cleaned up the town.</i>

416
00:39:52,789 --> 00:39:54,832
<i>I'm thinking of staying around
just to be sure.</i>

- Well, why not?</i>

<i>As a bounty hunter hive?</i>

422
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:13,560
<i>Some of my favorite people
are bounty hunters.</i>

423
00:40:13,643 --> 00:40:18,898
<i>And perhaps, this specimen of soldier
might consider joining our ranks.</i>

424
00:40:18,982 --> 00:40:22,485
<i>Yeah. I've got some clerical
concerns regarding my chain code.</i>
