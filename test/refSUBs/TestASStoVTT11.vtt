Do you want subtitles for any video?<br/>-=[ ai.OpenSubtitles.com ]=-

0:01:47.016 --> 0:01:48.096
Whoa whoa<br/>whoa whoa!

0:01:51.037 --> 0:01:53.007
Stop dumping.<br/>Stop dumping.

0:01:53.020 --> 0:01:55.067
- What is matter?<br/>- Lower your bed.

0:01:55.070 --> 0:01:58.041
You can't dump here no more.<br/>You need to talk to your boss.

0:01:58.047 --> 0:02:00.027
Always we are<br/>dumping here.

0:02:00.038 --> 0:02:02.021
Caballero, put the shit<br/>back in your truck.

0:02:02.028 --> 0:02:05.001
What?<br/>That is huge job!

0:02:12.015 --> 0:02:13.089
Where I am supposed<br/>to be dumping this now?

0:02:29.040 --> 0:02:33.024
I just now find out it's asbestos<br/>you've been dumping over there.

0:02:34.058 --> 0:02:36.038
What did you<br/>think it was?

0:02:36.048 --> 0:02:38.015
I never asked.

0:02:38.021 --> 0:02:40.052
<i>Tampax-- What the<br/>fuck do I know?</i>

0:02:40.065 --> 0:02:42.015
Well, now you know.

0:02:42.022 --> 0:02:44.025
You and your friend there stefano<br/>have been pocketing how much

0:02:44.035 --> 0:02:47.042
On this cowboys-And-Indian<br/>asbestos removal?

0:02:47.056 --> 0:02:48.092
Billing the townships

0:02:49.002 --> 0:02:52.009
Like you're following<br/>althe epa regulations.

0:02:52.023 --> 0:02:54.056
You got the same scam, Phil, so why<br/>don't we cut through the bullshit?

0:02:54.066 --> 0:02:56.070
<i>How much you figure<br/>you're owed on this?</i>

0:02:56.076 --> 0:02:59.000
- 25%.<br/>- Don't be an asshole.

0:02:59.010 --> 0:03:01.080
You know, there's close monitoring<br/>at every fucking landfill.

0:03:01.094 --> 0:03:04.011
Maybe if somebody had been<br/>upfront with me from the beginning.

0:03:04.017 --> 0:03:06.097
Nobody's been hiding nothing. I had the<br/>same dumping deal with what's-His-Name

0:03:07.001 --> 0:03:10.061
The operation's manager since I've<br/>been there at barone sanitation.

0:03:10.075 --> 0:03:13.011
You're not there<br/>no more. I am.

0:03:13.018 --> 0:03:16.002
You're enjoying your<br/>generous severance package.

0:03:16.012 --> 0:03:19.019
25%-- That's not<br/>gonna happen.

0:03:19.035 --> 0:03:22.036
You've got a backyard,<br/>a pool, dump it there.

0:03:22.046 --> 0:03:24.086
That's my only<br/>other suggestion.

0:03:31.077 --> 0:03:33.094
He's got us by the gazz'.<br/>I'll tell you that.

0:03:34.004 --> 0:03:36.060
Unless that guy at the pennsy<br/>landfill decides to play ball.

0:03:36.064 --> 0:03:39.077
That asshole's shitting his pants<br/>he'll get pinched by the epa.

0:03:39.087 --> 0:03:42.004
Frankly, Ton'

0:03:42.014 --> 0:03:43.088
I'm thinking maybe we<br/>should meet Phil's number.

0:03:43.095 --> 0:03:47.078
Why? I think that would set a<br/>terrible precedent right now.

0:03:47.092 --> 0:03:49.072
Just bend over...

0:03:49.082 --> 0:03:51.095
when he just became boss<br/>of the family over there?

0:03:52.005 --> 0:03:54.079
Yeah, well,<br/>that's the flying ointment.

0:03:56.012 --> 0:03:59.056
Even still,<br/>I say let him have it.

0:03:59.066 --> 0:04:01.033
Life's too short.

0:04:01.040 --> 0:04:04.090
It's also too short to<br/>live it as a fucking lackey.

0:04:04.097 --> 0:04:07.007
True too.

0:04:09.074 --> 0:04:11.024
What is this,<br/>"make-Believe ballroom"?

0:04:11.031 --> 0:04:13.098
How many times you gonna<br/>change the stations?

0:04:16.068 --> 0:04:18.075
This "departed" soundtrack's<br/>fucking killer.

0:04:18.091 --> 0:04:20.075
<i>- You got it?<br/>- Yeah, it's good.</i>

0:04:23.099 --> 0:04:27.032
Regarding, Phil,<br/>I gotta ask:

0:04:27.042 --> 0:04:30.049
Whatever happened to<br/>"stop and smell the roses"?

0:04:32.049 --> 0:04:34.030
You're right.

0:04:34.036 --> 0:04:36.076
U're right.

0:04:36.093 --> 0:04:40.010
You can't fight every<br/>fucking battle, right?

0:04:41.060 --> 0:04:45.071
Asbestos...

0:04:56.028 --> 0:04:58.008
each day's a gift.

0:04:58.012 --> 0:05:00.072
Every time I look at my<br/>kid, that's what I realiz

0:05:00.086 --> 0:05:03.056
And that shit<br/>with Junior, please.

0:05:09.096 --> 0:05:13.030
Just that peoplike Phil

0:05:13.047 --> 0:05:15.007
They're not<br/>on that page--

0:05:15.014 --> 0:05:18.014
Take those rosesand stick 'em up<br/>your ass, thorns first.

0:05:23.064 --> 0:05:26.065
<i>- This system's<br/>got no balls.</i>

0:05:55.091 --> 0:05:58.078
So how was your party<br/>that day at the hous

0:06:01.008 --> 0:06:03.022
Slow the fuck down,<br/>will ya?!

0:06:27.021 --> 0:06:28.061
Maybe you sh<br/>go back, heidi.

0:06:28.071 --> 0:06:30.098
Kennedy, I'm on my<br/>learner's permit after dark.

0:06:40.059 --> 0:06:43.022
Ton'...

0:06:45.023 --> 0:06:48.023
you gotta...<br/>help me.

0:06:48.040 --> 0:06:50.073
I'm coming.

0:06:53.000 --> 0:06:54.094
I'll never pass<br/>the drug test.

0:06:55.000 --> 0:06:57.051
What?

0:06:57.061 --> 0:06:59.064
You gotta get me out.

0:06:59.077 --> 0:07:01.081
I'll lose my license.

0:07:51.073 --> 0:07:54.090
Never pass a drug test.

0:07:54.096 --> 0:07:56.063
Call me a taxi.

0:09:22.055 --> 0:09:24.029
<i>911.</i>

0:09:24.039 --> 0:09:25.099
We've been<br/>in an accident.

0:09:26.012 --> 0:09:29.006
<i>Old pumping station road...</i>

0:09:29.022 --> 0:09:31.083
past the reservoir.

0:09:50.031 --> 0:09:51.085
Sorry about that.

0:09:51.095 --> 0:09:53.065
My friend...

0:09:53.078 --> 0:09:56.048
guy I came with,<br/>how is he?

0:09:56.062 --> 0:10:00.029
<i>Your friend is dead.<br/>Paramedics called it in the ambulance.</i>

0:10:00.042 --> 0:10:02.082
<i>Breathe in, please. Hold it.</i>

0:10:02.096 --> 0:10:05.059
Do you know a contact number<br/>for his next of kin?

0:10:06.066 --> 0:10:10.097
His wife.

0:10:22.014 --> 0:10:25.061
<i>- Hello.<br/>- Hello, may I speak with Carmela Soprano?</i>

0:10:25.068 --> 0:10:28.005
<i>- Who is this?<br/>- Nurse al rosario,</i>

0:10:28.015 --> 0:10:31.049
<i>St. Clare's hospital, denville.<br/>Is mrs. Soprano there?</i>

0:10:31.062 --> 0:10:33.049
Yes, this is<br/>mrs. Soprano.

0:10:33.062 --> 0:10:36.039
<i>I'm here with your husband.<br/>He'd like to speak with you.</i>

0:10:38.099 --> 0:10:42.050
<i>- Carm.<br/>- Tony, is everything okay?</i>

0:10:42.063 --> 0:10:44.003
<i>Are you sitting down?</i>

0:10:44.017 --> 0:10:46.040
<i>- I'm serious.<br/>- Yes, I'm in bed.</i>

0:10:46.050 --> 0:10:48.024
<i>All right, listen.</i>

0:10:48.034 --> 0:10:50.047
<i>Sweetheart,<br/>there's been an accident.</i>

0:10:51.097 --> 0:10:54.021
<i>We were coming back<br/>from the city and...</i>

0:10:55.051 --> 0:10:59.015
<i>- Christopher's dead.<br/>- Oh my God!</i>

0:10:59.021 --> 0:11:01.022
All right.

0:11:01.035 --> 0:11:03.065
- Carm.<br/>- What happened?

0:11:03.075 --> 0:11:07.036
He drove off the road<br/>and the car flipped over.

0:11:07.039 --> 0:11:09.099
<i>- I'll tell you in detail.<br/>- Are you okay?</i>

0:11:10.002 --> 0:11:11.099
I just banged my knee,<br/>the one from high school.

0:11:12.003 --> 0:11:14.003
I'm fine, but...

0:11:15.053 --> 0:11:17.023
he wasn't wearing<br/>a belt.

0:11:17.033 --> 0:11:19.017
Where are you,<br/>St. Clare's?

0:11:19.023 --> 0:11:23.004
Listen, they're gonna call<br/>kelli if they haven't already...

0:11:24.024 --> 0:11:26.017
just get al and rita<br/>on the phone

0:11:26.024 --> 0:11:28.001
And get 'em started<br/>over there.

0:11:28.004 --> 0:11:31.088
All right, all right.<br/>Oh my God, Tony, he's dead?

0:11:31.095 --> 0:11:34.001
Yeah.

0:11:34.005 --> 0:11:37.042
All right.<br/>L-Let me get dressed.

0:11:43.019 --> 0:11:45.023
Thank you.

0:12:09.088 --> 0:12:13.072
Mr. Tony,<br/>Mr. Sil is here.

0:12:13.079 --> 0:12:15.052
Okay.

0:12:15.056 --> 0:12:18.073
- Mrs. Carmela say you should stay in bed.<br/>- Have him come up.

0:12:18.079 --> 0:12:20.050
We're right here, Ton'.

0:12:20.056 --> 0:12:22.056
We came as soon<br/>as we heard.

0:12:24.033 --> 0:12:27.057
- Ton'.<br/>- Patsy went over to Chrissy's mom's house.

0:12:27.074 --> 0:12:30.014
- Yeah, that's where Carmela is.<br/>- Carlo's coming up.

0:12:30.024 --> 0:12:31.074
Yeah.

0:12:36.041 --> 0:12:38.098
- How you doing, Ton'?<br/>- My knee got banged up.

0:12:39.008 --> 0:12:41.008
<i>They said it's<br/>probably gonna be okay.</i>

0:12:42.060 --> 0:12:45.032
Last thing<br/>I remember was...

0:12:45.042 --> 0:12:47.036
we pulled away<br/>from Phil.

0:12:47.042 --> 0:12:49.092
Skid marks all over the<br/>place, the cops told Carm.

0:12:49.099 --> 0:12:52.099
He had a heavy foot,<br/>that kid, always.

0:12:53.009 --> 0:12:54.093
Almost put me through<br/>a billboard one time.

0:12:56.076 --> 0:12:59.000
- Hey, Ton'.<br/>- Come on in.

0:12:59.010 --> 0:13:01.040
I'm so sorry, Ton'.

0:13:01.047 --> 0:13:03.037
I still can't<br/>believe it.

0:13:03.050 --> 0:13:05.087
Thanks. I know<br/>you two were close.

0:13:05.094 --> 0:13:07.054
I was making<br/>my collections

0:13:07.071 --> 0:13:11.011
And Anthony maffei<br/>called me. Jesus.

0:13:15.088 --> 0:13:19.005
<i>It's carlo, I bet.</i>

0:13:19.015 --> 0:13:21.099
Fucking idiot didn't even<br/>have his seat belt on.

0:13:23.029 --> 0:13:26.006
His chest filled up.

0:13:27.023 --> 0:13:29.006
Suffocated<br/>on his own blood.

0:13:29.013 --> 0:13:31.097
- Oh, Jesus.<br/>- Jesus Christ.

0:13:32.007 --> 0:13:35.024
Seems like that's<br/>the cause of death.

0:13:37.014 --> 0:13:39.064
It's not carlo.<br/>I heard AJ.

0:13:39.071 --> 0:13:41.071
Carlo's coming up?

0:13:41.081 --> 0:13:43.091
What's with you and carlfucking arrival?

0:13:44.001 --> 0:13:47.045
- I'm just saying.<br/>- They're gonna do a full blood test on him.

0:13:47.048 --> 0:13:50.005
See, you know

0:13:50.015 --> 0:13:53.039
If alcohol

0:13:53.042 --> 0:13:56.089
- Drugs or...<br/>- It did occur to me.

0:13:57.003 --> 0:13:59.039
He didn't seem high,<br/>did he?

0:13:59.049 --> 0:14:01.036
Are you kidding?<br/>I would have been furi

0:14:01.043 --> 0:14:03.043
I would have fucking<br/>strangled him.

0:14:03.050 --> 0:14:05.090
He'd been working the program<br/>ever since he threw little Paulie

0:14:06.000 --> 0:14:08.084
- Out that window.<br/>- Let's not go there.

0:14:08.090 --> 0:14:11.021
Even before that<br/>he was battling that shit.

0:14:11.034 --> 0:14:13.017
He gave it his all.

0:14:13.034 --> 0:14:16.061
Well, anyway,<br/>he's gone now

0:14:16.068 --> 0:14:18.068
Our Chrissy.

0:14:20.008 --> 0:14:21.068
Crazy fucking maniac.

0:14:24.039 --> 0:14:25.085
The thing to take<br/>to heart, t

0:14:26.002 --> 0:14:27.099
You're here.<br/>You're all right.

0:14:28.002 --> 0:14:30.002
You could have been killed,<br/>for ck's sake.

0:14:30.019 --> 0:14:32.043
What are you gonna do?

0:14:35.086 --> 0:14:37.030
Thanks.

0:14:37.037 --> 0:14:39.070
Whoa.<br/>What are you doing?

0:14:39.080 --> 0:14:42.020
No no no, I gotta<br/>try and get up.

0:14:42.027 --> 0:14:45.074
Gotta go and meet Carm<br/>over at Chrissy's.

0:14:45.081 --> 0:14:47.088
Kelli and all that.

0:14:49.061 --> 0:14:51.038
I'll make you<br/>a plate.

0:14:51.045 --> 0:14:53.098
- Get me a scotch.<br/>- Are you serious?

0:14:54.005 --> 0:14:56.082
Yeah, and have<br/>one yourself.

0:15:00.056 --> 0:15:03.079
They were close,<br/>two cousins.

0:15:08.076 --> 0:15:10.057
You all right?

0:15:11.090 --> 0:15:14.067
I know I had my<br/>differences with that kid

0:15:14.074 --> 0:15:18.017
But maybe I didn't<br/>do right by him, neither.

0:15:18.024 --> 0:15:20.068
If you were his dad,<br/>I was his dutch uncle

0:15:20.074 --> 0:15:24.011
And what the fuck did<br/>I do but get pissed off

0:15:24.018 --> 0:15:27.092
Fight with him over<br/>cocksucking fucking money?

0:15:28.002 --> 0:15:30.092
I'd break his balls when<br/>he ied not to have a drink

0:15:30.099 --> 0:15:33.002
Or a little taste<br/>of snow.

0:15:33.012 --> 0:15:35.076
It's over, Paulie.

0:15:41.016 --> 0:15:43.067
Did anybody ever hear<br/>from the hospital?

0:15:43.077 --> 0:15:46.000
I was waiting<br/>till kelli woke up.

0:15:47.047 --> 0:15:50.037
They found cocaine<br/>in his blood.

0:15:50.044 --> 0:15:53.051
- Madonn'.<br/>- 'Cause of death was a hemothorax.

0:15:53.054 --> 0:15:56.061
Yeah, airbags can crush the ribs<br/>when there's no other restraint.

0:15:56.078 --> 0:15:59.061
They said he might<br/>have made it

0:15:59.078 --> 0:16:00.095
But he didn't.

0:16:01.005 --> 0:16:02.085
Couldn't have worn<br/>his goddamn seat belt?

0:16:02.095 --> 0:16:05.032
- No wonder. He was<br/>whack-A-Doo. - Al, just stop it.

0:16:05.035 --> 0:16:08.039
Aw, baloney. He leaves<br/>our granddaughter fatherless.

0:16:09.079 --> 0:16:11.096
My only child!

0:16:12.006 --> 0:16:14.030
Drinking won't help,<br/>honey.

0:16:14.036 --> 0:16:16.030
Jesus Christ.

0:16:20.030 --> 0:16:22.087
Look at this.<br/>Syracuse is losing.

0:16:27.088 --> 0:16:29.078
I don't know<br/>what to say.

0:16:29.088 --> 0:16:32.031
- What?<br/>- I just got a call from little Paulie.

0:16:33.028 --> 0:16:35.015
Nucci gualtieri died.

0:16:37.002 --> 0:16:39.062
Stroke on the bus back<br/>to the home.

0:16:39.069 --> 0:16:42.019
They had gone<br/>to see "Jersey boys."

0:16:44.093 --> 0:16:47.060
This is difficult.

0:16:47.070 --> 0:16:50.050
This is pain

0:16:50.067 --> 0:16:52.037
Like I'm not used to.

0:16:52.040 --> 0:16:55.077
We've said before he was<br/>like a son in some ways.

0:16:55.087 --> 0:16:58.004
To see him die<br/>like that...

0:16:59.004 --> 0:17:00.071
practically<br/>in my arms.

0:17:00.078 --> 0:17:04.035
He was just starting<br/>his life.

0:17:04.051 --> 0:17:07.035
Yeah.

0:17:15.039 --> 0:17:17.013
You know what?

0:17:18.053 --> 0:17:21.030
- This is bullshit.<br/>- What?

0:17:21.040 --> 0:17:24.003
I haven't been able<br/>to tell anybody this, but...

0:17:25.080 --> 0:17:27.094
I'm fucking relieved.

0:17:28.004 --> 0:17:29.087
Really?

0:17:29.097 --> 0:17:31.097
He was a tremendous drag<br/>on my emotions

0:17:32.004 --> 0:17:35.058
On my... thoughts<br/>about the future.

0:17:36.088 --> 0:17:38.085
Every morning<br/>I wake up thinking

0:17:38.088 --> 0:17:41.005
"Is today the day that<br/>one of my best friends

0:17:41.012 --> 0:17:43.022
Is gonna dime me<br/>to the FBI?"

0:17:43.042 --> 0:17:45.062
And a weak,<br/>fucking sniveling

0:17:45.065 --> 0:17:48.016
Lying drug addict? That's<br/>the worst kind of bet.

0:17:48.022 --> 0:17:51.023
The biggest blunder<br/>of my career

0:17:51.029 --> 0:17:53.053
Is now gone.

0:17:53.056 --> 0:17:57.007
And I don't have to be<br/>confronted by that fact no more.

0:17:58.023 --> 0:18:00.037
And as a relative,<br/>a friend

0:18:00.040 --> 0:18:03.040
Someone you can<br/>count on...

0:18:04.091 --> 0:18:06.077
I see.

0:18:11.061 --> 0:18:13.055
Let me tell you<br/>something:

0:18:13.065 --> 0:18:16.088
I've murdered friends<br/>before, even relatives--

0:18:17.002 --> 0:18:19.035
My cousin Tony

0:18:19.045 --> 0:18:21.092
My best friend--<br/>Puss.

0:18:23.062 --> 0:18:27.046
But this...

0:18:32.003 --> 0:18:34.044
was I talking<br/>in my sleep?

0:18:34.054 --> 0:18:36.080
Snoring.

0:18:36.087 --> 0:18:38.061
I'm gonna put on the TV<br/>if you don't mind.

0:18:38.067 --> 0:18:41.048
I can't stay asleep<br/>either. I'm all...

0:18:47.048 --> 0:18:50.039
I mean, I can laugh and cry,<br/>and I could always get the part.

0:18:50.049 --> 0:18:53.022
- First time?<br/>- First time. Never can keep it.

0:18:53.035 --> 0:18:55.049
They got onto me<br/>after a while.

0:18:55.062 --> 0:18:58.026
I'd lose my voice, fall<br/>down, get red in the face

0:18:58.036 --> 0:19:01.000
Talk too fast<br/>and couldn't act.

0:19:31.026 --> 0:19:33.073
Can you make me<br/>a cappuccino?

0:19:33.083 --> 0:19:36.083
That fucking machine from Paulie,<br/>you need a pilot's license.

0:19:40.060 --> 0:19:43.057
It's so hard not to think of<br/>Christopher as a child, isn't it?

0:19:43.061 --> 0:19:47.004
Caity kind of looks likeim,<br/>which makes it doubly hard

0:19:48.061 --> 0:19:50.091
Of course that's not<br/>gonna do her any favors

0:19:51.001 --> 0:19:53.055
When she hits puberty--<br/>That schnoz.

0:19:53.061 --> 0:19:56.018
A lot of women<br/>found him very attractive.

0:19:58.055 --> 0:20:01.029
I think to myself

0:20:01.046 --> 0:20:05.019
How could I have ever said<br/>those things about him

0:20:05.030 --> 0:20:09.003
About him and adriana, what<br/>her mother said he did to her?

0:20:15.010 --> 0:20:17.041
Obviously he was violent as an adult.

0:20:17.047 --> 0:20:21.014
His upbringing,<br/>but he adored Ade.

0:20:21.028 --> 0:20:23.075
He could never let<br/>himself take her life.

0:20:25.071 --> 0:20:27.038
Why are we<br/>so quick to blame?

0:20:27.048 --> 0:20:29.012
What is<br/>the attraction in that?

0:20:43.006 --> 0:20:45.007
It's good.

0:20:45.010 --> 0:20:47.007
Thank you.

0:20:49.014 --> 0:20:52.024
When I called you...

0:20:52.031 --> 0:20:53.094
the night after<br/>the accident

0:20:54.008 --> 0:20:55.081
And you asked me

0:20:55.091 --> 0:20:58.065
"Oh my God, Tony,<br/>he's dead?"

0:20:58.075 --> 0:21:00.085
Yeah.

0:21:00.092 --> 0:21:03.015
And I thought--

0:21:03.025 --> 0:21:06.015
Well, I thought<br/>I picked up a twinge of...

0:21:09.066 --> 0:21:11.059
- relief.<br/>- What?

0:21:11.066 --> 0:21:13.026
It just seemed like--<br/>I don't know--

0:21:13.033 --> 0:21:15.066
How could you say that? You don't<br/>know what you're talking about.

0:21:15.080 --> 0:21:17.010
Okay, good, I'm wrong.

0:21:17.020 --> 0:21:19.010
Maybe if you did pick up<br/>something like that

0:21:19.020 --> 0:21:21.034
Maybe it's because<br/>I warelieved...

0:21:21.047 --> 0:21:23.037
that it was him<br/>and not you.

0:21:23.047 --> 0:21:26.037
Well, don't feel bad about<br/>that. That makes sense.

0:21:29.038 --> 0:21:32.015
To be going down<br/>to the hospital again

0:21:32.021 --> 0:21:34.022
At 2:00 in the morning?

0:21:39.039 --> 0:21:41.062
And you know what?<br/>When you were shot

0:21:41.069 --> 0:21:43.096
It was Christopher<br/>who held me.

0:21:48.080 --> 0:21:51.070
You know<br/>the baby's car seat?

0:21:53.020 --> 0:21:55.087
A giant tree branch<br/>came through the window

0:21:55.090 --> 0:21:57.091
And demolished it.

0:22:00.048 --> 0:22:03.031
She would have<br/>been dead, caitlin

0:22:03.041 --> 0:22:05.048
Mangled beyond<br/>recognition.

0:22:18.039 --> 0:22:20.029
I told her about<br/>the baby seat

0:22:20.040 --> 0:22:22.033
So she wouldn't<br/>feel so rotten.

0:22:22.040 --> 0:22:25.003
I mean, he was high as a fucking<br/>kite. I didn't tell her that.

0:22:25.007 --> 0:22:28.060
In retrospect,<br/>maybe not the best approach.

0:22:28.067 --> 0:22:32.041
Right,<br/>I'm the asshole... again.

0:22:34.004 --> 0:22:36.044
What?

0:22:38.018 --> 0:22:40.001
No, go ahead.

0:22:41.058 --> 0:22:44.069
It's amazing<br/>how things work.

0:22:44.079 --> 0:22:48.026
His mother,<br/>cousin joanne

0:22:48.036 --> 0:22:50.002
A lush.

0:22:50.012 --> 0:22:52.096
Totally abandoned him<br/>as a parent

0:22:53.003 --> 0:22:55.076
But now she's reaping<br/>all the sympathy

0:22:55.086 --> 0:22:57.097
And the tears.

0:22:58.013 --> 0:23:00.070
How are you doing,<br/>Anthony?

0:23:02.054 --> 0:23:05.021
There have been<br/>some hard moments.

0:23:07.021 --> 0:23:09.054
But a weak,<br/>lying drug at

0:23:09.064 --> 0:23:11.061
Who fantasized<br/>about my downfall

0:23:11.065 --> 0:23:14.005
Who even showed people<br/>his filthy thoughts

0:23:14.015 --> 0:23:16.015
On a movie screen...?

0:23:18.012 --> 0:23:21.012
Let me tell you something:<br/>I've seen friends die before

0:23:21.022 --> 0:23:23.079
Accidents

0:23:23.089 --> 0:23:25.096
Even murder.

0:23:26.006 --> 0:23:28.006
My cousin Tony,<br/>they shot his face away.

0:23:28.016 --> 0:23:31.050
And I was fucking<br/>prostate with grief.

0:23:31.060 --> 0:23:33.013
But this?

0:23:34.034 --> 0:23:36.034
I see.

0:23:36.044 --> 0:23:38.064
And it occurs to me,<br/>I hand-Carried this kid

0:23:38.067 --> 0:23:41.018
Through the worst<br/>crisis he ever had.

0:23:43.018 --> 0:23:46.045
I can't go<br/>into particulars, but...

0:23:46.061 --> 0:23:48.078
wives, girlfriends

0:23:48.092 --> 0:23:50.069
They can complicate life<br/>in a major way.

0:23:50.085 --> 0:23:52.099
I don't have to<br/>tell you that.

0:23:56.032 --> 0:23:59.029
Anyway, huge problem<br/>of his own making.

0:24:01.050 --> 0:24:04.030
And he cried.<br/>He couldn't deal with it.

0:24:04.037 --> 0:24:06.010
So...

0:24:06.013 --> 0:24:08.097
I took up the slack.<br/>I handled it.

0:24:09.010 --> 0:24:11.004
I felt sorry<br/>for him.

0:24:12.047 --> 0:24:14.034
Now he talked gratitude...

0:24:16.004 --> 0:24:17.068
but guess what py<br/>produces in the recipient.

0:24:17.078 --> 0:24:19.088
<i>They shit<br/>on your pity.</i>

0:24:21.055 --> 0:24:24.052
That's what broke<br/>the camel's back.

0:24:24.062 --> 0:24:28.029
How are you<br/>handling all this?

0:24:28.036 --> 0:24:30.079
The worst part,<br/>truthfully

0:24:30.089 --> 0:24:33.006
Is I gotta sit there

0:24:33.016 --> 0:24:36.063
Withple<br/>who are hurting... bad.

0:24:37.083 --> 0:24:41.000
And I gotta have<br/>the long face

0:24:41.007 --> 0:24:44.001
And the sighing<br/>and the platitudes.

0:24:45.057 --> 0:24:47.054
But I don't feel it.

0:24:50.024 --> 0:24:52.051
Then that makes me feel<br/>like a hypocrite.

0:24:54.068 --> 0:24:57.005
And that makes<br/>me mad at them.

0:25:20.004 --> 0:25:22.028
Oh, hi.

0:25:22.034 --> 0:25:24.095
How are you?

0:25:30.002 --> 0:25:31.042
Julianna skiffle

0:25:31.052 --> 0:25:34.026
This is my wife<br/>Carmela Soprano.

0:25:34.039 --> 0:25:35.072
Skiff.

0:25:35.086 --> 0:25:37.093
Oh, yeah, right.

0:25:38.006 --> 0:25:41.073
Julianna's a real estate<br/>agent in the old neighborhood.

0:25:41.080 --> 0:25:43.070
And you knew<br/>Christopher?

0:25:43.080 --> 0:25:45.047
I used to buy my meat<br/>at Satriale's.

0:25:49.010 --> 0:25:52.044
I'm a recovering addict.

0:25:53.071 --> 0:25:56.044
- I owe him a lot.<br/>- That's nice to hear.

0:25:58.091 --> 0:26:02.005
- Well, what are you gonna do, huh?<br/>- Nothing you can do.

0:26:02.008 --> 0:26:04.055
That's my point.

0:26:04.062 --> 0:26:06.025
He was too young.

0:26:08.082 --> 0:26:10.089
Good-Looking woman.

0:26:30.098 --> 0:26:33.025
They did<br/>a beautiful job on him.

0:26:40.036 --> 0:26:42.059
Oh, I'm gonna go up.

0:26:43.086 --> 0:26:46.066
I'll go up later

0:26:46.076 --> 0:26:49.066
Give my seat to someone<br/>in the meantime.

0:26:54.047 --> 0:26:56.047
How are you doing?

0:26:59.017 --> 0:27:02.021
- It's tough.<br/>- Yeah.

0:27:02.031 --> 0:27:04.048
He loved y so much.

0:27:05.078 --> 0:27:08.038
- Yeah?<br/>- Well, you know he did.

0:27:14.032 --> 0:27:16.039
I'll go up later.

0:27:33.021 --> 0:27:36.048
There she is.<br/>3 to 5, 7 to 9.

0:27:36.058 --> 0:27:38.015
<i>Why do they call her that?</i>

0:27:38.021 --> 0:27:39.075
She never<br/>misses a wake.

0:27:45.009 --> 0:27:46.049
Oh, lord, oh, lord!

0:27:46.055 --> 0:27:48.056
Fucking<br/>James brown now.

0:27:51.073 --> 0:27:53.093
I'm serious.<br/>I can't take it.

0:27:54.000 --> 0:27:57.050
It's all right.<br/>We're here for you.

0:27:57.057 --> 0:28:00.010
Oh my God.<br/>Look at this.

0:28:04.034 --> 0:28:07.051
- Like a movie star.<br/>- Jackie kennedy.

0:28:25.076 --> 0:28:28.030
- I'm sorry for the loss of your cousin, bro.<br/>- Thanks.

0:28:28.040 --> 0:28:31.047
Me too, bro, me too.

0:28:31.057 --> 0:28:33.070
He was a good guy.

0:28:33.077 --> 0:28:37.011
Hey, don't let<br/>this linger

0:28:37.024 --> 0:28:38.051
On your head now.

0:28:38.071 --> 0:28:39.081
You know what<br/>I'm talking about.

0:28:51.065 --> 0:28:53.032
You know that night

0:28:53.042 --> 0:28:55.059
A tree limb came in<br/>through the car window

0:28:55.066 --> 0:28:59.006
Completely destroyed<br/>the baby seat.

0:28:59.013 --> 0:29:01.030
Tony.

0:29:01.043 --> 0:29:04.030
You guys are gonna<br/>hang in a while, right?

0:29:04.043 --> 0:29:07.007
We really should make an<br/>appearance at the other wake.

0:29:26.049 --> 0:29:28.079
Are we that late?

0:29:28.086 --> 0:29:30.066
Glad you came.

0:29:30.079 --> 0:29:32.093
- He'll appreciate it.<br/>- Oh, please.

0:29:48.098 --> 0:29:50.081
I gotta<br/>get out of here.

0:29:54.098 --> 0:29:56.095
- Paul.<br/>- Ton'.

0:29:57.099 --> 0:29:59.099
Thanks for coming.

0:30:01.062 --> 0:30:03.073
We are so sorry<br/>for your loss, Paulie.

0:30:03.079 --> 0:30:05.086
How you hangin' in,<br/>paolucc'?

0:30:05.099 --> 0:30:07.040
As well as can be expected.

0:30:07.050 --> 0:30:09.016
Must be very<br/>hard for you.

0:30:09.023 --> 0:30:11.017
I know how close the two<br/>of you had become again

0:30:11.023 --> 0:30:12.067
Yeah.

0:30:12.080 --> 0:30:14.047
Not much<br/>of a sendoff here.

0:30:14.050 --> 0:30:17.081
- The room is beautiful, Paulie.<br/>- Nobody's in it.

0:30:17.087 --> 0:30:19.057
What kind<br/>of testament is this

0:30:19.067 --> 0:30:21.034
To the spirit and<br/>generosity of the woman?

0:30:21.041 --> 0:30:23.008
We're here<br/>for you, Paulie.

0:30:23.018 --> 0:30:24.081
You know that.

0:30:24.088 --> 0:30:26.035
Okay.

0:30:31.032 --> 0:30:33.032
It's a fundamental<br/>lack of respect

0:30:33.035 --> 0:30:35.022
And I'm never gonna<br/>fuckin' forget it, neither.

0:30:35.036 --> 0:30:38.026
Jesus, Paulie, people your<br/>mother's age, their friends die off.

0:30:38.036 --> 0:30:40.016
What, she outlived<br/>sil? Carlo?

0:30:40.030 --> 0:30:41.086
They're all over there<br/>at your nephew's.

0:30:42.000 --> 0:30:44.053
- Yeah, but-- - Councilman<br/>carillo was here three minutes.

0:30:44.060 --> 0:30:46.017
I clocked him.

0:30:48.054 --> 0:30:51.037
People are comin'<br/>and they don't, fuck 'em.

0:30:51.041 --> 0:30:53.074
I got 500 prayer cards.

0:30:53.088 --> 0:30:55.011
Well, Carm and I aere.

0:30:55.018 --> 0:30:56.034
What the fuck<br/>is that? Nothin'?

0:30:57.061 --> 0:30:59.018
No, Ton', of course not.

0:30:59.025 --> 0:31:01.088
- Means the world.<br/>- Okay.

0:31:03.058 --> 0:31:05.035
She suffered too,<br/>you know.

0:31:05.042 --> 0:31:08.006
Yeah, well, this isn't<br/>the time or the place.

0:31:08.019 --> 0:31:09.096
You're right.

0:31:13.036 --> 0:31:15.003
How have you been<br/>dealing witht?

0:31:15.006 --> 0:31:17.097
It's really sad but it's<br/>kinda the same as with blanca.

0:31:18.003 --> 0:31:21.017
I mean, I don't really just keep<br/>thinking about things the way I did--

0:31:21.020 --> 0:31:23.034
Over and over,<br/>you know?

0:31:23.037 --> 0:31:26.037
Well, for one thing,<br/>perhaps the meds are working.

0:31:27.098 --> 0:31:29.064
Did you finally enroll?

0:31:29.078 --> 0:31:31.071
I'm in a few classes

0:31:31.088 --> 0:31:34.022
Unofficially, until my<br/>transcript clears from ramapo.

0:31:34.032 --> 0:31:36.032
Beginning english.

0:31:36.038 --> 0:31:38.089
Oh, and I went<br/>to a class on the history

0:31:39.005 --> 0:31:40.079
Of the israeli-Palestinian<br/>conflict.

0:31:40.092 --> 0:31:44.006
- Wow.<br/>- I mean, it's hard to pick up in the middle.

0:31:44.016 --> 0:31:46.033
I might take it<br/>xt semester.

0:31:46.039 --> 0:31:48.066
I mean, it's so<br/>dicked-Up over there

0:31:48.080 --> 0:31:51.010
And no one knows<br/>who started it.

0:31:51.017 --> 0:31:52.080
- Are you sleeping?<br/>- What? In class?

0:31:52.097 --> 0:31:56.010
No. You were having<br/>trouble, remember?

0:31:58.007 --> 0:32:00.044
Wellbutrin xl<br/>kicks ass.

0:32:00.051 --> 0:32:02.094
I'm hearing good things<br/>about the lexapro.

0:32:02.098 --> 0:32:05.008
Check it, paisan.<br/>Long John shithead.

0:32:08.005 --> 0:32:10.018
That kid's in my<br/>south American lit class.

0:32:10.028 --> 0:32:12.035
He had his toes amputated.

0:32:17.029 --> 0:32:19.013
He said it was an accident<br/>with his car battery.

0:32:19.016 --> 0:32:20.080
Acid burned right<br/>through his shoe.

0:32:36.071 --> 0:32:39.035
Oh, you litt<br/>shfooyadell.

0:32:39.048 --> 0:32:41.012
She should nurse.

0:32:42.015 --> 0:32:43.089
At least somebody<br/>feels like eating.

0:32:45.035 --> 0:32:47.066
She doesn't know.

0:32:47.072 --> 0:32:49.076
Isn't God wonderful<br/>that way?

0:32:59.090 --> 0:33:02.097
<i>- Hello?<br/>- Alan, it's Tony. You busy?</i>

0:33:03.007 --> 0:33:04.071
Usual shit--<br/>Some Japanese guy

0:33:04.081 --> 0:33:07.014
Got his suit ruined<br/>at cirque du soleil.

0:33:07.018 --> 0:33:09.098
<i>- Listen, I need a suite.<br/>- So all the guys coming out?</i>

0:33:10.008 --> 0:33:11.088
No no. I'm solo.

0:33:11.098 --> 0:33:14.085
Oh. We'll see what<br/>we can do about that.

0:33:15.002 --> 0:33:18.009
<i>Look, I just want to-<br/>Peace and quiet...</i>

0:33:18.022 --> 0:33:20.072
- ...chill out.<br/>- You set for transpo?

0:33:20.082 --> 0:33:23.019
<i>I'll be happy<br/>to send a plane.</i>

0:33:58.036 --> 0:33:59.059
No more bets.

0:34:02.003 --> 0:34:05.003
33 black odd.

0:34:15.021 --> 0:34:16.041
No more bets.

0:34:18.091 --> 0:34:21.092
Five red odd.

0:34:56.008 --> 0:34:58.015
It's hard to imagine<br/>for a poet

0:34:58.025 --> 0:35:01.069
But wordsworth<br/>was as rich and popular

0:35:01.079 --> 0:35:03.046
As, say, someone like

0:35:03.059 --> 0:35:05.096
<i>John grisham nowadays.</i>

0:35:06.003 --> 0:35:08.010
But wordsworth writes

0:35:08.020 --> 0:35:10.083
"The world is<br/>too much with us."

0:35:10.093 --> 0:35:13.020
Later, he invokes<br/>nature again.

0:35:14.084 --> 0:35:18.034
Why such strong words<br/>against the material world?

0:36:02.058 --> 0:36:05.042
That was fast.

0:36:05.052 --> 0:36:07.026
The gatehouse<br/>usually gives

0:36:07.039 --> 0:36:09.039
Shitty directions to<br/>the east tower. Come in.

0:36:11.076 --> 0:36:13.070
<i>So...</i>

0:36:14.093 --> 0:36:18.000
you're a friend<br/>of Chris.

0:36:18.007 --> 0:36:20.037
Yeah...<br/>Tony, by the way.

0:36:20.047 --> 0:36:22.024
No, I know.

0:36:22.034 --> 0:36:23.087
He's mentioned you,<br/>actually.

0:36:23.094 --> 0:36:26.057
Well, I heard nothing<br/>but nice things about you.

0:36:27.094 --> 0:36:31.051
Except... you're more<br/>beautiful than he let on.

0:36:31.061 --> 0:36:33.068
<i>- Really?<br/>- Talked about ya...</i>

0:36:33.075 --> 0:36:36.068
a few times, told me more<br/>than once to look you up.

0:36:36.075 --> 0:36:38.009
Did he?

0:36:39.052 --> 0:36:41.029
Well well well.

0:36:44.053 --> 0:36:46.013
You want a drink<br/>or something?

0:36:46.026 --> 0:36:48.096
I got some pinot grigio<br/>in the fridge.

0:36:54.080 --> 0:36:57.044
I got some, uh...

0:36:57.054 --> 0:36:59.064
serious news.

0:36:59.071 --> 0:37:02.004
- Uh-Oh.<br/>- It's about Christopher.

0:37:03.054 --> 0:37:05.071
- He's dead.<br/>- At?

0:37:06.088 --> 0:37:08.055
It was a car accident

0:37:08.065 --> 0:37:10.082
Happened<br/>a couple days ago.

0:37:14.006 --> 0:37:15.089
Oh my God.

0:37:16.089 --> 0:37:19.006
That's fucking awful.

0:37:19.023 --> 0:37:21.003
I'm sorry.

0:37:21.006 --> 0:37:24.043
- What happened?<br/>- Bad wreck...

0:37:24.050 --> 0:37:26.063
high-Speed...

0:37:28.017 --> 0:37:29.080
he was killed instantly.

0:37:29.090 --> 0:37:31.081
Somehow, I walked away.

0:37:31.091 --> 0:37:33.094
Jesus, that must<br/>have been scary.

0:37:34.001 --> 0:37:37.025
The fuckin' sound alone...

0:37:37.031 --> 0:37:39.091
did he ever...

0:37:40.008 --> 0:37:42.058
marry that one girl--The one wh-

0:37:42.065 --> 0:37:44.035
No.

0:37:45.042 --> 0:37:47.026
Found a real sweetheart,<br/>though-- Kelli--

0:37:47.036 --> 0:37:49.026
And...

0:37:49.036 --> 0:37:51.003
they just had<br/>a baby girl.

0:37:51.009 --> 0:37:53.009
Maybe that's good,<br/>you know?

0:37:54.050 --> 0:37:57.077
I mean,<br/>bad that he left her

0:37:57.087 --> 0:38:00.067
But good that he--<br/>He left something.

0:38:06.044 --> 0:38:08.061
I thought<br/>you should know.

0:38:13.068 --> 0:38:15.062
Well, um...

0:38:18.079 --> 0:38:21.029
extremely cool, you coming<br/>over here. I appreciate that.

0:38:23.039 --> 0:38:25.073
- How long you here for?<br/>- I don't know.

0:38:25.079 --> 0:38:28.080
Just play it as I go.

0:38:49.015 --> 0:38:51.032
<i>- What's up?<br/>- It's stefano.</i>

0:38:51.039 --> 0:38:54.026
Look, I'm sorry to bother you,<br/>but I'm here at the school.

0:38:54.039 --> 0:38:56.009
<i>The asbestos,<br/>it's backing up.</i>

0:38:56.016 --> 0:38:57.099
<i>I've gotta dump<br/>this shit.</i>

0:38:58.016 --> 0:39:00.026
<i>It's not wrapped to code and<br/>all the other violations--</i>

0:39:00.033 --> 0:39:03.016
- Yeah?<br/>- I could get nailed big time.

0:39:03.023 --> 0:39:05.020
We're workin' on it, John.

0:39:05.033 --> 0:39:06.077
I'm trying<br/>to negotiate it out

0:39:06.083 --> 0:39:08.044
But the asshole's<br/>taking a hard line for now.

0:39:08.047 --> 0:39:11.001
Just hang in there,<br/>let me do my thing.

0:39:11.011 --> 0:39:12.094
All right.

0:39:18.075 --> 0:39:20.035
- Whoa.<br/>- Jeff'll clean it up.

0:39:20.042 --> 0:39:22.022
Make him clean it<br/>in his bare feet.

0:39:22.028 --> 0:39:25.035
I got the venison steaks!

0:39:25.052 --> 0:39:29.042
Oh!

0:39:29.056 --> 0:39:31.059
Oh!

0:39:32.076 --> 0:39:35.020
What the fuck?<br/>You blind?

0:39:35.036 --> 0:39:38.000
Me?! You open the door,<br/>you don't look at all.

0:39:38.010 --> 0:39:40.007
Aw, shit, you wrecked<br/>my fuckin' door.

0:39:40.013 --> 0:39:42.037
- You did that to your own door!<br/>- Whoa whoa whoa.

0:39:42.047 --> 0:39:44.004
What the fuck<br/>did you say?

0:39:44.011 --> 0:39:46.031
I said he opened the door,<br/>he don't look at all.

0:39:46.041 --> 0:39:48.008
Look at my fuckin' bike!

0:39:48.014 --> 0:39:50.001
- Do you hear this guy?<br/>- You saw it!

0:39:50.011 --> 0:39:52.065
Fuck you, nigger.

0:39:54.065 --> 0:39:56.015
I am not a nigger!

0:39:56.028 --> 0:39:58.065
I am from somalia!<br/>I go to school and I work!

0:39:58.075 --> 0:40:00.022
Do not call me<br/>a nigger!

0:40:00.032 --> 0:40:02.032
So you're some<br/>terrorist piece of shit.

0:40:02.039 --> 0:40:05.006
Either way, motherfucker,<br/>you're in the wrong neighborhood.

0:40:05.013 --> 0:40:06.089
Get the fuck away!

0:40:08.066 --> 0:40:10.050
You a tough nigger now?!

0:40:10.057 --> 0:40:12.050
You got something to say?

0:40:14.030 --> 0:40:16.074
<i>Cocksucker!</i>

0:40:57.021 --> 0:41:00.025
Do you mind?

0:41:00.031 --> 0:41:03.038
No, knock yourself out.

0:41:06.062 --> 0:41:09.039
This is the--

0:41:09.049 --> 0:41:12.003
This is the new shit--

0:41:12.013 --> 0:41:14.066
Medical-Grade, mellow

0:41:14.073 --> 0:41:16.073
Paranoia-Free.

0:41:19.000 --> 0:41:21.070
Oh, well, that's good.

0:41:28.021 --> 0:41:31.048
Oh, Chris loved<br/>to party.

0:41:31.058 --> 0:41:33.098
What's your point?

0:41:34.005 --> 0:41:36.098
Nothing.<br/>You just...

0:41:37.005 --> 0:41:39.082
remind me<br/>of him, obviously.

0:41:41.082 --> 0:41:44.016
What's that mean?<br/>I fuck like him?

0:41:47.043 --> 0:41:50.000
So much<br/>for paranoia-Free.

0:41:50.010 --> 0:41:52.060
No, you were his<br/>friend, that's all.

0:41:52.067 --> 0:41:55.017
Why would you<br/>bring him up?

0:41:55.024 --> 0:41:58.001
All I'm saying

0:41:58.007 --> 0:41:59.061
Is that there's<br/>a certain kind of guy

0:41:59.067 --> 0:42:01.094
That I don't run into<br/>on campus.

0:42:02.001 --> 0:42:04.041
But where I dance--

0:42:04.055 --> 0:42:07.018
That accent,<br/>the clothes.

0:42:07.028 --> 0:42:08.085
I'm a type?

0:42:09.002 --> 0:42:11.069
This coming from the girl who's<br/>stripping her way through college?

0:42:11.079 --> 0:42:14.052
Actually,<br/>you're a surprise.

0:42:14.062 --> 0:42:16.069
Chris sometimes talked<br/>about some sad shit

0:42:16.086 --> 0:42:19.003
But you seem--<br/>I don't know--

0:42:20.073 --> 0:42:22.013
Actually sad.

0:42:22.020 --> 0:42:25.013
Not right now I'm not.

0:42:25.020 --> 0:42:27.087
Jesus, this is some<br/>pretty fucking amazing dope.

0:42:29.080 --> 0:42:32.061
Chris said you two...

0:42:32.071 --> 0:42:34.041
took peyote together.

0:42:34.048 --> 0:42:36.048
Yeah.

0:42:36.058 --> 0:42:40.015
I mean, I haven't done<br/>buttons in a while, though.

0:42:45.042 --> 0:42:47.092
You know, I've been thinking<br/>why the fuck I'm here.

0:42:47.099 --> 0:42:49.082
You can get<br/>to that place.

0:42:49.096 --> 0:42:52.093
No. No, I mean Vegas.

0:42:52.099 --> 0:42:56.000
<i>Truth is I always wanted<br/>to try that shit...</i>

0:42:57.063 --> 0:42:59.080
but I always had

0:42:59.093 --> 0:43:02.080
All the responsibilities.

0:43:07.008 --> 0:43:09.091
You're a hard man<br/>to reach.

0:43:09.098 --> 0:43:11.085
Nobody's seen hide<br/>nor hair.

0:43:11.091 --> 0:43:13.078
Yeah, I'm away.<br/>What do you want?

0:43:13.088 --> 0:43:15.072
<i>What do I want?<br/>I'm returning your call.</i>

0:43:15.082 --> 0:43:17.055
I think this got nothing<br/>to do with asbestos.

0:43:17.062 --> 0:43:20.029
Why don't you let go of the<br/>old shit and be a businessman?

0:43:20.036 --> 0:43:22.096
- You got everything you want.<br/>- Not everything.

0:43:23.002 --> 0:43:26.059
But listen, allow me<br/>to express my condolences

0:43:26.076 --> 0:43:28.060
Regarding your nephew.

0:43:28.070 --> 0:43:30.016
This is me hanging up.

0:43:39.081 --> 0:43:42.048
- I can tell you're upset.<br/>- Big fucking deal.

0:43:42.054 --> 0:43:46.051
- What exactly happened this week?<br/>- Nothing.

0:43:48.022 --> 0:43:51.095
You know, people walk around<br/>like this is all something.

0:43:51.099 --> 0:43:54.029
They'rfucking laughing

0:43:54.036 --> 0:43:56.019
And nobody takes<br/>even one second

0:43:56.032 --> 0:43:58.006
To think about<br/>what's really going on.

0:43:58.016 --> 0:44:00.013
You sound<br/>depressed again.

0:44:00.019 --> 0:44:03.040
How can anybody not be?<br/>You'd have to be fucking nuts

0:44:03.053 --> 0:44:05.033
Not to be.

0:44:05.040 --> 0:44:08.030
I mean, you'd have to have<br/>your head wedged so far

0:44:08.037 --> 0:44:10.030
Up your ass that all<br/>you could see

0:44:10.037 --> 0:44:12.054
Is your own stupid face.

0:44:12.067 --> 0:44:14.048
What specifically<br/>are you talking about?

0:44:14.054 --> 0:44:18.015
I mean, everything<br/>is so fucked up.

0:44:22.008 --> 0:44:24.092
Why can't we all<br/>just get along?

0:44:30.096 --> 0:44:33.080
You don't have to<br/>chew it.

0:44:35.030 --> 0:44:37.047
You just wash it down<br/>like a pill.

0:46:45.036 --> 0:46:48.046
It's the same principle<br/>as the solar system.

0:46:55.014 --> 0:46:58.047
No more bets.

0:47:00.038 --> 0:47:03.008
- 24.<br/>- Yes.

0:47:04.021 --> 0:47:05.075
Nice.

0:47:10.082 --> 0:47:13.092
Press it all.

0:47:23.056 --> 0:47:25.077
No more bets.

0:47:31.004 --> 0:47:32.087
20.

0:47:32.094 --> 0:47:35.071
Holy fucking shit.

0:47:42.045 --> 0:47:44.089
Here.

0:47:44.095 --> 0:47:46.095
Much appreciated.

0:47:59.013 --> 0:48:01.087
<i>No more bets.</i>

0:48:15.078 --> 0:48:18.012
24 again.

0:48:28.050 --> 0:48:31.053
- He's dead.<br/>- What?

0:48:31.060 --> 0:48:33.060
What?

0:48:46.015 --> 0:48:47.025
What?

0:50:10.033 --> 0:50:12.020
I get it.

0:50:19.077 --> 0:50:23.008
I get it!
