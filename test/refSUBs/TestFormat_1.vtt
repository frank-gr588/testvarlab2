0:02:29.018 --> 0:02:31.194
<b>What happened to poor Nippy?</b>

0:02:31.325 --> 0:02:35.198
<b>Ah. It was my fault.</b>

0:02:35.329 --> 0:02:37.244
<b>I was driving

Something got into him.</b>

0:02:41.204 --> 0:02:43.250
<b>He saw a cat or something...
But he jumped.</b>

0:02:43.380 --> 0:02:44.599
<b>Oh, no.</b>

0:02:44.729 --> 0:02:45.904
<b>I pulled right over,</b>

<b>screaming my head off,
"Nippyyyy!"</b>

0:02:48.037 --> 0:02:50.387
<b>Ohh.But... he was gone.</b>

0:02:50.518 --> 0:02:52.433
<b>Oh, that's terrible.</b>

<b>When I can get this thing going.</b>

0:03:07.578 --> 0:03:09.972
<b>Maybe just a little push.</b>

0:03:12.061 --> 0:03:13.802
<b>Well, if you're sure

<b>Okay, okay, okay.</b>

0:05:25.847 --> 0:05:28.545
<b>Actually,
it's my favorite meal to cook.</b>

0:05:28.676 --> 0:05:31.853
<b>Hmm. I like it. And I think
my secret is...</b>

0:05:31.983 --> 0:05:33.289
<b>Ma?</b>

0:05:33.420 --> 0:05:35.552
<b>In the kitchen, Jeffie!</b>

0:05:35.683 --> 0:05:36.988
<b>I have a little trick.</b>

0:05:37.119 --> 0:05:38.773
<b>I bet it's the same
we do in my family.</b>

0:05:38.903 --> 0:05:40.340
<b>An egg.
I knew it.</b>

0:05:40.470 --> 0:05:42.080
<b>And you really work it in.</b>

0:05:42.211 --> 0:05:43.821
<b>I mean, you got to use
your hands.</b>

0:05:43.952 --> 0:05:45.475
<b>You are speaking my language.</b>

0:05:45.606 --> 0:05:49.087
<b>Do you cook? Uh, just a few favorites,
nothing fancy.</b>

0:05:49.218 --> 0:05:51.394
<b>Yeah, simple's best.
I mean, why fuss?</b>

0:05:51.525 --> 0:05:55.746
<b>Oh. Jeffie, this is Mr. Takavic.</b>

0:05:55.877 --> 0:05:58.749
<b>Oh, please,
Mr. Takavic was my father.</b>

0:05:58.880 --> 0:06:01.752
<b>Call me "Gene."</b>

0:06:01.883 --> 0:06:04.842
<b>Don't worry, hon,
he's not an ax murderer.</b>

0:06:04.973 --> 0:06:08.063
<b>If he was gonna chop me to bits
he'd have done it already.</b>

0:06:08.193 --> 0:06:10.979
<b>Right, Gene?</b>

0:06:12.894 --> 0:06:17.420
<b>Well, don't just stand there
like a bump on a log, join us.</b>

0:06:19.814 --> 0:06:22.686
<b>Sometimes he gets a little
nervous around new people.</b>

0:06:22.817 --> 0:06:24.732
<b>Ma... Well, you do.</b>

0:06:24.862 --> 0:06:26.037
<b>Now come on.</b>

0:06:26.168 --> 0:06:29.171
<b>Grab a glass and sit down.</b>

0:06:40.225 --> 0:06:41.575
<b>Tell him how we met, Gene.</b>

0:06:41.705 --> 0:06:42.706
<b>Oh, yeah.</b>

0:06:42.837 --> 0:06:44.926
<b>Uh, well,
I was looking for Nippy...</b>

0:06:45.056 --> 0:06:46.056
<b>Yeah.
His dog, poor thing.</b>

0:06:46.144 --> 0:06:47.363
<b>Well, he ran away.</b>

0:06:47.494 --> 0:06:49.365
<b>And Gene here
was putting up posters.</b>

0:06:49.496 --> 0:06:51.336
<b>And your mom was on her way back
from Hansen's.</b>

0:06:51.367 --> 0:06:53.630
<b>And my wheels got stuck
in the snow.</b>

0:06:53.761 --> 0:06:55.391
<b>Well, that was before
the whole thing conked out.</b>

0:06:55.415 --> 0:06:58.330
<b>Yeah, but Gene here
saved the day.</b>

0:06:58.461 --> 0:07:01.899
<b>He even fixed my dumb scooter...
With duct tape!</b>

0:07:02.030 --> 0:07:05.250
<b>Ah.</b>

0:07:05.381 --> 0:07:07.035
<b>To Gene. Come on.</b>

0:07:07.165 --> 0:07:08.732
<b>Yeah.Ahh...</b>

0:07:11.692 --> 0:07:14.608
<b>Mm.</b>

0:07:14.738 --> 0:07:19.569
<b>So your mom tells me
you're a cab driver?</b>

0:07:22.267 --> 0:07:25.880
<b>Have you ever driven
anyone famous?</b>

0:07:26.010 --> 0:07:27.272
<b>Oh, he sure did.</b>

0:07:27.403 --> 0:07:28.665
<b>Tell him, Jeffie.</b>

0:07:33.322 --> 0:07:34.845
<b>Sammy Hagar.</b>

0:07:34.976 --> 0:07:36.717
<b>No!

0:07:36.847 --> 0:07:37.979
<b>Hey, I love him.</b>

0:07:42.026 --> 0:07:43.026
<b>That's it! Hey!</b>

0:07:44.420 --> 0:07:47.336
<b>What was he like?
Big tipper?</b>

0:07:47.467 --> 0:07:49.730
<b>I guess.</b>

0:07:49.860 --> 0:07:51.732
<b>Mm.Oh. You know what?
You stay comfy.</b>

0:07:51.862 --> 0:07:55.039
<b>I will rescue
this beautiful creation.</b>

0:07:56.171 --> 0:07:57.955
<b>Look at that.</b>

0:08:00.088 --> 0:08:01.350
<b>Ta-da!</b>

0:08:01.481 --> 0:08:03.352
<b>Gene's staying for dinner.</b>

0:08:18.715 --> 0:08:20.369
<b>Dude, what the fuck?!</b>

0:08:20.500 --> 0:08:22.042
<b>I know it's awkward, right?</b>

0:08:22.066 --> 0:08:24.634
<b>But you don't have to
call me "dad." Yet.</b>

0:08:24.765 --> 0:08:27.115
<b>I dunno what this is about...
But all I have to do</b>

0:08:27.245 --> 0:08:29.813
<b>is pick up the phone

0:08:29.944 --> 0:08:32.139
<b>Yeah, but you haven't picked up
the phone yet, have you?</b>

0:08:32.163 --> 0:08:34.165
<b>Or tried to strong-arm me
for cash.</b>

0:08:34.296 --> 0:08:36.559
<b>And guess what?
I know why.</b>

0:08:36.690 --> 0:08:39.910
<b>Because reward money,
blackmail...</b>

0:08:40.041 --> 0:08:41.366
<b>That's not gonna
tickle your pickle.</b>

0:08:41.390 --> 0:08:43.348
<b>I know what you really want.</b>

0:08:43.479 --> 0:08:46.700

<b>The ladies.</b>

0:16:06.487 --> 0:16:08.619
<b>Watching my waistline.</b>

0:16:08.750 --> 0:16:11.405
<b>Yeah, but every now
and then... No harm, right?</b>

0:16:13.929 --> 0:16:16.540
<b>Oh, wow.</b>

0:16:18.107 --> 0:16:19.761
<b>Mmm.</b>

0:16:31.294 --> 0:16:34.776
<b>Mmm.
Mm-mm-mmm-mmm-mmm.</b>

0:16:37.866 --> 0:16:40.042
<b>So, did you catch the game
last night?</b>

0:16:41.783 --> 0:16:43.828
<b>The game?</b>

0:16:43.959 --> 0:16:47.658
<b>What the hell is wrong
with those guys?</b>

0:16:47.789 --> 0:16:49.834
<b>I can't even talk about it.</b>

0:16:49.965 --> 0:16:51.271
<b>Mm.</b>

0:16:51.401 --> 0:16:54.274
<b>Really thought
this was the year.</b>

0:16:54.404 --> 0:16:55.623
<b>Yeah, me too.</b>

0:16:55.753 --> 0:16:57.059
<b>Mm.</b>

0:16:57.190 --> 0:17:00.236
<b>You know,
Texas wasn't even ranked.</b>

0:17:00.367 --> 0:17:02.543
<b>I know.</b>

0:17:02.673 --> 0:17:04.849
<b>Play-calling was crazy.</b>

0:17:04.980 --> 0:17:06.199
<b>The worst.</b>

0:17:06.329 --> 0:17:10.159
<b>Three downs to make
a foot and a half?</b>

0:17:10.290 --> 0:17:12.640
<b>How hard can it be?</b>

0:17:12.770 --> 0:17:16.383
<b>Well, you can't win
when Martinez plays like that.</b>

0:17:16.513 --> 0:17:17.819
<b>Martinez.</b>

0:17:17.949 --> 0:17:20.865
<b>I mean, what's up with him?</b>

0:17:20.996 --> 0:17:23.216
<b>You think something's off?</b>

0:17:23.346 --> 0:17:25.261
<b>Maybe.</b>

0:17:25.392 --> 0:17:27.220
<b>Mm.</b>

0:17:27.350 --> 0:17:29.439
<b>Next week, Oklahoma State.</b>

0:17:29.570 --> 0:17:31.920
<b>The Okies.
Huh?</b>

0:17:32.051 --> 0:17:33.443
<b>Uh, that's what we called them.</b>

0:17:33.574 --> 0:17:37.143
<b>You ever done the drive?
Topeka, Wichita... Nice.</b>

0:17:37.186 --> 0:17:39.058
<b>Well, then you haven't done it.</b>

0:17:39.188 --> 0:17:40.494
<b>Can't beat Memorial.</b>

0:17:40.624 --> 0:17:41.624
<b>Damn straight.</b>

0:17:41.669 --> 0:17:42.539
<b>What do you love most?</b>

0:17:42.670 --> 0:17:44.150
<b>Now, that's a tough one.</b>

0:17:44.280 --> 0:17:45.649
<b>You think Weedon'll come through
on his home turf?</b>

0:17:45.673 --> 0:17:47.066
<b>Yeah.
No way!</b>

0:17:47.196 --> 0:17:48.850
<b>With that thumb? Thumb's a dealbreaker.</b>

0:17:48.980 --> 0:17:51.157
<b>I'll tell you something.</b>

0:17:51.287 --> 0:17:54.595
<b>The Cougar helmet
was the thumb-breaker.</b>

0:17:57.032 --> 0:17:59.034
<b>Mmm.
Mm-mm-mmm.</b>

0:17:59.165 --> 0:18:00.862
<b>Delicious.</b>

0:18:00.992 --> 0:18:02.559
<b>Mmm!</b>

0:18:06.128 --> 0:18:08.739
<b>Welp, I should probably
be heading back.</b>

0:18:08.870 --> 0:18:10.263
<b>Well, thanks again.</b>

0:18:10.393 --> 0:18:11.593
<b>Oh, it's the least I could do.</b>

0:18:11.655 --> 0:18:12.655
<b>Have a good one.</b>

0:18:12.700 --> 0:18:14.354
<b>Come back anytime.</b>

0:19:05.361 --> 0:19:07.711
<b>Have a good night,
Gene. Goodnight, Krista.</b>

0:19:07.842 --> 0:19:09.322
<b>Goodnight.Goodnight.</b>

0:19:49.536 --> 0:19:50.667
<b>Frank?</b>

0:19:50.798 --> 0:19:53.017
<b>Gene, Gene,
the Cinnabon machine.</b>

0:19:53.148 --> 0:19:55.455
<b>I could smell ya
coming up the hallway.</b>

0:19:55.585 --> 0:19:57.239
<b>Oh, I get that all the time.</b>

0:19:57.370 --> 0:19:58.980
<b>Here you go, guys.</b>

0:19:59.110 --> 0:20:00.373
<b>Hey, can I...</b>

0:20:00.503 --> 0:20:02.679
<b>Hey, Gene, don't even ask.
Grab a coffee.</b>

0:20:02.810 --> 0:20:04.464
<b>That was one hell
of a game, huh?</b>

0:20:04.594 --> 0:20:06.030
<b>What were you thinking
at halftime?</b>

0:20:06.161 --> 0:20:08.642
<b>Well, uh, I was thinking,</b>

0:20:08.772 --> 0:20:11.384
<b>"Hey, this could, uh...</b>

0:20:11.514 --> 0:20:13.342
<b>This could be a long one."</b>

0:20:13.473 --> 0:20:15.538
<b>And I tell you, you know who
I'm not bitching about today?</b>

0:20:15.562 --> 0:20:18.260
<b>Pelini. Nah.Pelini. That's...
Yeah, the coach.</b>

0:20:18.391 --> 0:20:19.977
<b>You know me.
I go at him when things are bad,</b>

0:20:20.001 --> 0:20:22.177
<b>but when he does something good,
I'm all about it.</b>

0:20:40.064 --> 0:20:41.588
<b>Goodnight, Gene. Goodnight!</b>

0:21:00.259 --> 0:21:01.738
<b>They got him in there
for a reason.</b>

0:21:01.869 --> 0:21:04.263
<b>Mm-mmm-mmm.
Mmm.</b>

0:21:53.834 --> 0:21:55.488
<b>I still got it.</b>

0:22:07.064 --> 0:22:09.763
<b>Mm-mm-mm-mmm-mmm.</b>

0:22:34.353 --> 0:22:35.615
<b>Can I help you, sir?</b>

0:22:35.745 --> 0:22:36.790
<b>Oh, yeah.</b>

0:22:36.920 --> 0:22:37.965
<b>Uh, no thanks.</b>

0:22:38.095 --> 0:22:39.793
<b>I'm just browsing.</b>

0:22:39.923 --> 0:22:41.577
<b>Okay. Yeah.</b>

0:22:51.674 --> 0:22:56.157
<b>4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9...</b>

0:22:59.682 --> 0:23:01.423
<b>14...</b>

<b>15, 17, 18.</b>

0:23:13.566 --> 0:23:16.395
<b>6, 7, 8, 9, 10.</b>

0:24:00.700 --> 0:24:03.833
<b>2...</b>

0:24:03.964 --> 0:24:06.662
<b>11, 12, 13,</b>

0:24:06.793 --> 0:24:09.317
<b>14, 15.</b>

0:24:09.448 --> 0:24:11.537
<b>Alright. Aaand...</b>

0:24:11.667 --> 0:24:12.842
<b>17 feet.</b>

0:24:12.973 --> 0:24:13.973
<b>Right here.</b>

0:24:23.157 --> 0:24:24.288
<b>Ribbon it off.</b>

0:24:24.419 --> 0:24:25.289
<b>Come on.</b>

0:24:25.420 --> 0:24:27.248
<b>All the way, guys.</b>

0:24:32.427 --> 0:24:33.950
<b>Okay.</b>

0:24:33.994 --> 0:24:36.126
<b>Check, check, one, two.
One, two.</b>

0:24:36.170 --> 0:24:37.780
<b>Alright, let's move.</b>

0:24:37.824 --> 0:24:40.522
<b>Starting position.
Right down there.</b>

0:24:43.482 --> 0:24:45.048
<b>Alright, we ready?</b>

0:24:45.092 --> 0:24:47.224
<b>And grab your bag!</b>

0:24:47.268 --> 0:24:49.313
<b>And go!</b>

0:24:49.357 --> 0:24:51.446
<b>That's it!
Move! Move!</b>

0:24:51.490 --> 0:24:53.274
<b>Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go!</b>

0:24:53.317 --> 0:24:55.363
<b>One!
Armani suits and run!</b>

0:24:56.669 --> 0:24:59.280
<b>Two!
Air Jordan shoes for you!</b>

0:25:02.457 --> 0:25:05.286
<b>Three!
Linen shirts for free!</b>

0:25:08.289 --> 0:25:11.814
<b>Four!
Cashmere sweaters out the door!</b>

0:25:11.858 --> 0:25:14.382
<b>Five!
Patagonias to survive!</b>

0:25:16.036 --> 0:25:18.865
<b>Six!
Swanky sweatsuits in the mix!</b>

0:25:18.908 --> 0:25:21.128
<b>Halt!
Ohh. What?</b>

0:25:21.258 --> 0:25:22.259
<b>Too many.</b>

0:25:22.390 --> 0:25:23.696
<b>You gotta be precise.</b>

0:25:23.826 --> 0:25:25.088
<b>Just three of each.</b>

0:25:25.219 --> 0:25:26.699
<b>Why?</b>

0:25:26.829 --> 0:25:28.701
<b>And why do I gotta run
around like an asshole?</b>

0:25:28.831 --> 0:25:29.919
<b>I already told you.</b>

0:25:30.050 --> 0:25:31.225
<b>Three minutes.</b>

0:25:31.355 --> 0:25:32.705
<b>Got it?
That's our window.</b>

0:25:32.835 --> 0:25:35.664
<b>Yeah, but why three minutes?</b>

0:25:35.795 --> 0:25:38.058
<b>Because at three minutes,
that's when security sees you</b>

0:25:38.188 --> 0:25:41.409
<b>on the cameras and the cops haul
your ass to jail, alright?</b>

0:25:41.540 --> 0:25:43.803
<b>So let's go. Wait...
there's cameras?</b>

0:25:43.933 --> 0:25:45.631
<b>Sure, there's cameras!</b>

0:25:45.761 --> 0:25:48.155
<b>They erase the tapes
every 72 hours.</b>

0:25:48.285 --> 0:25:50.287
<b>So that's why you only
take three of each.</b>

0:25:50.418 --> 0:25:52.289
<b>And only the pricey stuff.</b>

0:25:52.420 --> 0:25:53.900
<b>When the store opens
the next morning,</b>

0:25:53.987 --> 0:25:55.554
<b>they won't even know
they were robbed.</b>

0:25:55.684 --> 0:25:58.600
<b>By the time they do inventory,
abracadabra!</b>

0:25:58.731 --> 0:26:00.950
<b>No more Jeffie on the tape,
right?</b>

0:26:01.081 --> 0:26:04.737
<b>So, three items, three minutes.</b>

0:26:04.867 --> 0:26:05.955
<b>It's easy.</b>

0:26:06.086 --> 0:26:08.044
<b>Let's go.</b>

0:26:08.175 --> 0:26:09.176
<b>How many of each?</b>

0:26:09.306 --> 0:26:10.569
<b>Three.</b>

0:26:10.699 --> 0:26:12.962
<b>Pigs get fat,
hogs get slaughtered.</b>

0:26:13.093 --> 0:26:14.355
<b>I dunno...</b>

0:26:16.792 --> 0:26:18.359
<b>What don't you know?</b>

0:26:19.969 --> 0:26:22.189
<b>It's just, this whole thing...
It seems crazy.</b>

0:26:22.319 --> 0:26:23.320
<b>Is this too hot for you?</b>

0:26:23.451 --> 0:26:24.670
<b>You know, just say so.</b>

0:26:24.800 --> 0:26:26.802
<b>You know what?
Screw it.</b>

0:26:26.933 --> 0:26:28.282
<b>"Crazy"?</b>

0:26:28.412 --> 0:26:29.849
<b>I'll tell you what's crazy.</b>

0:26:29.979 --> 0:26:32.112
<b>Fifty-year-old
high school chemistry teacher</b>

0:26:32.242 --> 0:26:33.853
<b>comes into my office.</b>

0:26:33.983 --> 0:26:37.247
<b>The guy is so broke,
he can't pay his own mortgage.</b>

0:26:37.378 --> 0:26:39.249
<b>One year later,
he's got a pile of cash</b>

0:26:39.380 --> 0:26:41.164
<b>as big as a Volkswagen.</b>

0:26:41.295 --> 0:26:43.993
<b>That's crazy.</b>

0:26:44.124 --> 0:26:46.126
<b>I'll do it.</b>

0:26:46.256 --> 0:26:48.563
<b>This sounds good to you?</b>

0:26:50.521 --> 0:26:52.175
<b>I think it'll work.</b>

0:26:52.306 --> 0:26:53.568
<b>Well, look at you.</b>

0:26:53.699 --> 0:26:55.091
<b>You're young.</b>

0:26:55.222 --> 0:26:57.441
<b>You're probably, uh,
fast on the feet, huh?</b>

0:26:57.572 --> 0:26:59.748
<b>Okay, I-I didn't say
I wouldn't do it.</b>

0:26:59.879 --> 0:27:04.405
<b>I just had some questions
about, like, logistics.</b>

0:27:06.059 --> 0:27:07.756
<b>Are you in or out?</b>

0:27:12.935 --> 0:27:13.980
<b>In.</b>

0:27:14.110 --> 0:27:15.851
<b>Okay.</b>

0:27:15.982 --> 0:27:18.549
<b>Back to one.</b>

0:27:18.593 --> 0:27:20.726
<b>Check, test, one, two, one, two.</b>

0:27:20.769 --> 0:27:24.381
<b>Okay, and ready, set, action!</b>

0:27:24.425 --> 0:27:26.645
<b>Move! Move! Move!</b>

0:27:26.688 --> 0:27:28.777
<b>Pick up the pace!
Go! Go! Go!</b>

0:27:28.821 --> 0:27:31.606
<b>One!
Armani suits and run!</b>

0:27:31.650 --> 0:27:33.434
<b>Two!
Air Jordan shoes for you!</b>

0:27:33.477 --> 0:27:36.176
<b>Three!

<b>Four!

<b>Five!
Patagonias to survive!</b>

0:27:40.963 --> 0:27:43.270
<b>Six!
Swanky sweatsuits in the mix!</b>

0:27:43.313 --> 0:27:44.445
<b>Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go!</b>

0:28:03.551 --> 0:28:05.553
<b>Barbara?
Yes?</b>

0:28:05.684 --> 0:28:08.469
<b>Let's ask maintenance
to give this area a polish.</b>

0:28:08.599 --> 0:28:10.123
<b>Got it, I'll call now.</b>

0:28:10.253 --> 0:28:12.473
<b>Thanks.</b>

0:28:12.603 --> 0:28:14.518
<b>Okay, then.
Have a good night.</b>

0:28:14.649 --> 0:28:15.519
<b>You too.</b>

0:28:15.650 --> 0:28:17.217
<b>Excuse me, ma'am?</b>

0:28:17.347 --> 0:28:19.349
<b>There's a delivery.</b>

0:28:19.480 --> 0:28:21.134
<b>A delivery?</b>

0:28:24.441 --> 0:28:25.921
<b>No.</b>

0:28:26.052 --> 0:28:26.879
<b>No, no.</b>

0:28:27.009 --> 0:28:29.403
<b>Stop.</b>

0:28:29.533 --> 0:28:31.579
<b>You are not leaving that thing
on my loading dock.</b>

0:28:31.710 --> 0:28:32.972
<b>No way.</b>

0:28:34.930 --> 0:28:38.325
<b>Fourteen twelve
Cottonwood Drive...</b>

0:28:38.455 --> 0:28:40.109
<b>Dock... Dock D.</b>

0:28:40.240 --> 0:28:41.676
<b>Let me see.</b>

0:28:44.679 --> 0:28:47.160
<b>Two-stroke engine sprayer pumps?</b>

0:28:47.290 --> 0:28:48.683
<b>This is a department store.</b>

0:28:48.814 --> 0:28:51.338
<b>Does it look like
we use sprayer pumps here?</b>

0:28:51.468 --> 0:28:53.906
<b>Well, we don't.</b>

0:28:54.036 --> 0:28:56.430
<b>I was given this address, ma'am.</b>

0:28:56.560 --> 0:28:58.998
<b>I need to talk
to your supervisor.</b>

0:28:59.128 --> 0:29:01.522
<b>Got it.
You stay right here.</b>

0:29:21.063 --> 0:29:23.544
<b>Dispatch. Steve.</b>

0:29:23.587 --> 0:29:25.024
<b>Yes... this is Kathy Deutsch,</b>

<b>I'm the manager

<b>And you guys
just delivered something</b>

0:29:28.767 --> 0:29:31.117
<b>that we did not order.
Really?</b>

0:29:31.247 --> 0:29:34.685
<b>Your guy brought a giant wooden
crate onto my loading dock,</b>

0:29:34.816 --> 0:29:38.037
<b>seems to be some kind
of spraying system.</b>

0:29:38.167 --> 0:29:42.606
<b>The invoice number
is 1-9-6-8-AE35.</b>

0:29:42.737 --> 0:29:45.435
<b>Okay, just, uh, give me a second

0:29:45.566 --> 0:29:47.742
<b>Uh...
Uh, sprayer pump.</b>

0:29:47.873 --> 0:29:49.004
<b>Yeah, I think I got it.</b>

0:29:49.135 --> 0:29:50.832
<b>Omaha, right?</b>

0:29:50.876 --> 0:29:52.791
<b>Yes, but I run
a department store.</b>

0:29:52.834 --> 0:29:54.705
<b>We don't sell anything
like that.</b>

0:29:54.749 --> 0:29:56.620
<b>Clearly this is a mistake

0:29:56.751 --> 0:29:59.275

<b>Everybody has bad days.</b>

0:41:21.174 --> 0:41:22.741
<b>You've felt like this?</b>

0:41:25.265 --> 0:41:28.964
<b>No, I mean, not me...
But people.</b>

0:41:29.095 --> 0:41:30.792

<b>I'm thinking maybe

0:43:19.684 --> 0:43:20.859
<b>What's the occasion?</b>

<b>Um, what size are you?</b>

<b>Uh...

0:43:49.627 --> 0:43:51.150
<b>Really?</b>

0:44:20.832 --> 0:44:23.878
<b>Look. Ooh la la! Ooh la la!</b>

0:44:27.882 --> 0:44:29.623
<b>Buongiorno, ladies!</b>

0:44:29.754 --> 0:44:30.905
<b>How much you think
we can get for 'em?</b>

0:44:30.929 --> 0:44:32.529
<b>I don't know.
Maybe... five hundred each?</b>

0:44:32.626 --> 0:44:33.671
<b>But shit, man.</b>

0:44:33.801 --> 0:44:35.368
<b>Maybe I just keep 'em
for myself.</b>

0:44:35.498 --> 0:44:36.891
<b>I've been eyeing these Jordans.</b>

0:44:37.022 --> 0:44:40.547
<b>You guys enjoying yourselves?</b>

0:44:40.678 --> 0:44:41.838
<b>Well, hold onto that feeling.</b>

0:44:41.896 --> 0:44:43.419
<b>'Cause this is it.</b>

0:44:43.550 --> 0:44:44.551
<b>Yeah, we know.</b>

0:44:44.682 --> 0:44:46.292
<b>Well, in case you forget...</b>

0:44:46.422 --> 0:44:47.772
<b>You transported stolen goods</b>

0:44:47.902 --> 0:44:49.817
<b>with a value exceeding
five thousand dollars.</b>

0:44:49.948 --> 0:44:52.559
<b>And the truck you used to do it
was rented in Council Bluffs,</b>

0:44:52.690 --> 0:44:53.952
<b>across state lines.</b>

0:44:54.082 --> 0:44:56.389
<b>You told us to rent
the truck over there...</b>

0:44:56.519 --> 0:44:58.043
<b>Theft from
an Interstate Shipment.</b>

<b>Conspiracy to commit

0:45:05.790 --> 0:45:08.793
<b>Whoa, whoa. "Conspiracy"?
It was your idea.</b>

0:45:08.923 --> 0:45:11.709
<b>Yeah. It's called
"mutually assured destruction."</b>

0:45:11.839 --> 0:45:15.974
<b>So, if I go down, you go down.</b>

0:45:16.104 --> 0:45:17.299
<b>Man, you don't
havta threaten us.</b>

0:45:17.323 --> 0:45:18.716
<b>We're all friends here.</b>

0:45:21.631 --> 0:45:24.330
<b>I am not your friend.</b>

0:45:24.460 --> 0:45:25.940
<b>And if you get greedy
and you decide</b>

0:45:26.071 --> 0:45:28.900
<b>to come back for more, don't.</b>

0:45:29.030 --> 0:45:30.771
<b>Gene Takavic...
You never heard of him.</b>

0:45:30.902 --> 0:45:33.339
<b>The Cottonwood Mall?
You don't go there.</b>

0:45:33.469 --> 0:45:37.778
<b>You see me coming, you cross
to the other side of the street.</b>

0:45:37.909 --> 0:45:39.388
<b>Dude...</b>

0:45:39.519 --> 0:45:42.565
<b>Now I need you to say it:
"we're done."</b>

0:45:44.611 --> 0:45:46.526
<b>Come on! Say it.</b>

0:45:46.656 --> 0:45:48.963
<b>"We're. Done."</b>

0:45:49.094 --> 0:45:50.530
<b>Say it.</b>

0:46:00.279 --> 0:46:03.238
<b>We're done.</b>

0:46:03.369 --> 0:46:06.154
<b>We're... We're done.</b>

0:46:06.285 --> 0:46:07.721
<b>Gene?</b>

0:46:11.159 --> 0:46:13.335
<b>Hey, Gene, I see your car!</b>

0:46:17.731 --> 0:46:19.472
<b>Gene?</b>

0:46:30.918 --> 0:46:32.833
<b>Well, that's a start.</b>

0:46:32.964 --> 0:46:35.662
<b>Looks like your problem
is the master cylinder.</b>

0:46:35.793 --> 0:46:39.013
<b>Look at you boys, hard at work.</b>

0:46:39.144 --> 0:46:42.843
<b>Well, Marion, guys,
I got to get going.</b>

0:46:42.974 --> 0:46:45.150
<b>I will take another look
next time.</b>

0:46:45.280 --> 0:46:46.847
<b>Wait a minute.</b>

0:46:46.978 --> 0:46:48.607
<b>No, you can't go anywhere
looking like that.</b>

0:46:48.631 --> 0:46:51.025
<b>Come on inside and wash up.</b>

0:46:51.156 --> 0:46:53.071
<b>Ma...</b>

0:46:53.201 --> 0:46:55.638
<b>Jeffie, don't vex me.
Come on, Gene.</b>

0:46:55.769 --> 0:46:56.877
<b>You can help me
with the groceries.</b>

0:46:56.901 --> 0:46:59.599
<b>Huh, Gene? Sounds like a plan.</b>

0:47:11.219 --> 0:47:13.395
<b>Nice of you to
help Jeffie with his car.</b>

0:47:15.223 --> 0:47:18.748
<b>You might not know it, but
my boy's had some tough times.</b>

0:47:18.879 --> 0:47:23.666
<b>He, uh... He fell in with
a bad crowd back in Albuquerque.</b>

0:47:23.797 --> 0:47:27.105
<b>Albuquerque, huh?
Never been.</b>

0:47:27.235 --> 0:47:29.063
<b>Lucky you.</b>

0:47:29.194 --> 0:47:31.892
<b>But things are so much better
for Jeffie here.</b>

0:47:32.023 --> 0:47:35.156
<b>Even more so
now that he knows you.</b>

0:47:35.287 --> 0:47:38.507
<b>You're a good influence, Gene.</b>

0:47:38.638 --> 0:47:39.726
<b>Oh, where's my brain?</b>

0:47:39.857 --> 0:47:43.121
<b>I keep forgetting to ask you
about Nippy.</b>

0:47:44.600 --> 0:47:45.645
<b>Nippy?</b>

0:47:45.775 --> 0:47:48.648
<b>Oh, oh, right.</b>

0:47:48.778 --> 0:47:49.605
<b>You're not gonna believe this,</b>

0:47:49.736 --> 0:47:51.956
<b>but, uh, he was with a family</b>

0:47:52.086 --> 0:47:54.045
<b>the whole time, just...
Just a few blocks away.</b>

0:47:54.175 --> 0:47:55.481
<b>Oh, well, that's wonderful!</b>

0:47:55.611 --> 0:47:57.265
<b>Yeah.
He's in great shape.</b>

0:47:57.396 --> 0:48:01.095
<b>So, after all that...</b>

0:48:01.226 --> 0:48:03.097
<b>a happy ending.</b>

0:48:03.228 --> 0:48:04.751
<b>Oh, well...</b>

0:48:15.414 --> 0:48:17.503
<b>Here you go, Ma'am.

0:48:17.633 --> 0:48:19.548
<b>And looky here.</b>

0:48:22.900 --> 0:48:25.250
<b>For you, m'lady. Thank you.</b>

0:48:28.514 --> 0:48:31.125
<b>Hey, Gene,
aren't you taking lunch?</b>

0:48:31.256 --> 0:48:32.866
<b>Huh?</b>

0:48:35.477 --> 0:48:37.175
<b>Thanks.</b>

0:50:38.252 --> 0:50:42.430
<b>I get it.
You get over it, okay?</b>

0:50:42.561 --> 0:50:44.258
<b>Please, believe me.</b>

0:50:44.389 --> 0:50:47.740
<b>Before you know it,

<b>Go.</b>
