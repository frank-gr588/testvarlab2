<SYNC Start=26130 End=28508><P>Our world was shattered by the Empire.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=33263 End=35598><P>You're going
to have to relocate the covert.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=35682 End=36891><P>This is the Way.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=36975 End=40645><P>In the wake of your destruction,
it was left behind.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=40770 End=42564><P>Is it still a hunter?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=42647 End=44816><P>No. But it will protect.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=44899 End=47235><P>You got a real thing for droids,
don't you?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=47777 End=49612><P>I got a real thing for that droid.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=49696 End=51155><P>Let me take the child to him...</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=51239 End=52782><P>Let's kill him and get out of here.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=52866 End=55535><P>- We both need the client to be eliminated.
- He's right.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=55618 End=58013><P>As long as the Imp lives,
he'll send hunters after the child.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=58037 End=59038><P><i>It's a trap.</i></P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=59122 End=61833><P><i>- Have they brought the child?</i>

<SYNC Start=146751 End=148920><P>Awaiting confirmation.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=149337 End=150338><P>Knock it off!</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=152382 End=155009><P>Waiting for confirmation

<SYNC Start=155093 End=157679><P><i>That's a go to proceed,

<SYNC Start=170733 End=172902><P>Oh, who knows?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=172986 End=176322><P>These guys like to lay down the law
when they first arrive into town.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=176406 End=178241><P>You know how it is.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=178783 End=181870><P>I said, shut up. Yeesh.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=182453 End=183913><P>What is that thing, anyway?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=183997 End=184998><P>Uh, I don't know.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=185081 End=187750><P>Maybe Moff wants to eat it.
I don't ask questions.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=190003 End=191004><P>Can I see it?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=191838 End=193840><P>Did you not just hear
that Moff Gideon killed</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=193923 End=195842><P>a dozen of his own troopers
to make a point.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=195925 End=197927><P>- Okay.

<SYNC Start=198469 End=199971><P>- Do you get the point?
- Yes.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=200054 End=201055><P>Okay.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=227582 End=229375><P>Should we offer
that thing some water?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=229459 End=230835><P>You just wanna look at it.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=230919 End=232295><P>So what?
You got to see it!</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=232378 End=233379><P>Barely.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=233463 End=236507><P>I mean, I grabbed it up off the ground
and I stuffed it in the sack.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=237091 End=238593><P>It's more than I got to see it.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=238676 End=241804><P>Look, I'm not taking it out of
this bag until I deliver it to the Moff.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=242180 End=244724><P>- Fine.
- Okay. Stop asking.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=249646 End=252232><P>Let me check on this thing. This is crazy.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=252315 End=253358><P>Any update yet?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=253441 End=256194><P><i>That's a negative.
Still waiting on confirmation.</i></P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=256277 End=258088><P><i>He just killed an officer
for interrupting him,</i></P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=258112 End=260114><P><i>- so this might take a while.</i></P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=260198 End=261824><P>Thank you.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=261908 End=264452><P>Standing by still. Unbelievable.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=266037 End=268581><P>Hey, how long has it been
since that thing moved?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=268665 End=271042><P>I don't know,
like a minute or two. Don't worry.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=271834 End=273878><P>Uh, it's been
way longer than a minute.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=273962 End=274963><P>Oh, my God.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=275046 End=277090><P>Shouldn't we check
and see if it's still alive?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=277173 End=278466><P>You hit it pretty hard.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=278550 End=279842><P>You just wanna see it.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=279926 End=281636><P>We should check
and see if it's hurt.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=281719 End=283763><P>The last thing that you want
is to give Gideon a bag</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=283846 End=285807><P>and have him open it
and find whatever is dead...</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=285890 End=287559><P>Okay. Okay, look.
Here you go. See?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=287642 End=290478><P>Take a peek. Everything's fine.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=290562 End=291563><P>What is that?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=291855 End=293606><P>I don't know.
It's a pet or something.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=293690 End=295149><P>A pet? I thought you...</P></SYNC>

<SYNC Start=377815 End=379192><P>No, that's it.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=381027 End=383279><P>- What about the sewers?
- Sewers?</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=383363 End=385740><P>The Mandalorians
have a covert down in the sewers.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=385823 End=388076><P>If we can get down there,

<SYNC Start=470700 End=474245><P>I would prefer to avoid

<SYNC Start=572343 End=576514><P>which at this time involves
your cooperation and benefit.</P></SYNC>
<SYNC Start=580226 End=585231><P>I will give you until nightfall, and then
