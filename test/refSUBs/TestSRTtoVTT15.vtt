Do you want subtitles for any video?<br/>-=[ ai.OpenSubtitles.com ]=-

0:01:47.166 --> 0:01:48.968
Whoa whoa<br/>whoa whoa!

0:01:51.371 --> 0:01:53.072
Stop dumping.<br/>Stop dumping.

0:01:53.206 --> 0:01:55.675
- What is matter?<br/>- Lower your bed.

0:01:55.708 --> 0:01:58.411
You can't dump here no more.<br/>You need to talk to your boss.

0:01:58.478 --> 0:02:00.279
Always we are<br/>dumping here.

0:02:00.380 --> 0:02:02.215
Caballero, put the shit<br/>back in your truck.

0:02:02.281 --> 0:02:05.018
What?<br/>That is huge job!

0:02:12.158 --> 0:02:13.893
Where I am supposed<br/>to be dumping this now?

0:02:29.409 --> 0:02:33.246
I just now find out it's asbestos<br/>you've been dumping over there.

0:02:34.588 --> 0:02:36.380
What did you<br/>think it was?

0:02:36.481 --> 0:02:38.158
I never asked.

0:02:38.214 --> 0:02:40.521
<i>Tampax-- What the<br/>fuck do I know?</i>

0:02:40.659 --> 0:02:42.150
Well, now you know.

0:02:42.229 --> 0:02:44.251
You and your friend there stefano<br/>have been pocketing how much

0:02:44.357 --> 0:02:47.420
On this cowboys-And-Indian<br/>asbestos removal?

0:02:47.565 --> 0:02:48.920
Billing the townships

0:02:49.027 --> 0:02:52.092
Like you're following<br/>althe epa regulations.

0:02:52.236 --> 0:02:54.563
You got the same scam, Phil, so why<br/>don't we cut through the bullshit?

0:02:54.667 --> 0:02:56.701
<i>How much you figure<br/>you're owed on this?</i>

0:02:56.766 --> 0:02:59.000
- 25%.<br/>- Don't be an asshole.

0:02:59.108 --> 0:03:01.803
You know, there's close monitoring<br/>at every fucking landfill.

0:03:01.946 --> 0:03:04.113
Maybe if somebody had been<br/>upfront with me from the beginning.

0:03:04.176 --> 0:03:06.973
Nobody's been hiding nothing. I had the<br/>same dumping deal with what's-His-Name,

0:03:07.018 --> 0:03:10.612
The operation's manager since I've<br/>been there at barone sanitation.

0:03:10.756 --> 0:03:13.112
You're not there<br/>no more. I am.

0:03:13.186 --> 0:03:16.023
You're enjoying your<br/>generous severance package.

0:03:16.126 --> 0:03:19.190
25%-- That's not<br/>gonna happen.

0:03:19.358 --> 0:03:22.362
You've got a backyard,<br/>a pool, dump it there.

0:03:22.466 --> 0:03:24.863
That's my only<br/>other suggestion.

0:03:31.778 --> 0:03:33.942
He's got us by the gazz'.<br/>I'll tell you that.

0:03:34.046 --> 0:03:36.600
Unless that guy at the pennsy<br/>landfill decides to play ball.

0:03:36.647 --> 0:03:39.771
That asshole's shitting his pants<br/>he'll get pinched by the epa.

0:03:39.876 --> 0:03:42.042
Frankly, Ton',

0:03:42.146 --> 0:03:43.880
I'm thinking maybe we<br/>should meet Phil's number.

0:03:43.957 --> 0:03:47.783
Why? I think that would set a<br/>terrible precedent right now.

0:03:47.925 --> 0:03:49.722
Just bend over...

0:03:49.826 --> 0:03:51.951
when he just became boss<br/>of the family over there?

0:03:52.056 --> 0:03:54.791
Yeah, well,<br/>that's the flying ointment.

0:03:56.125 --> 0:03:59.560
Even still,<br/>I say let him have it.

0:03:59.666 --> 0:04:01.330
Life's too short.

0:04:01.406 --> 0:04:04.900
It's also too short to<br/>live it as a fucking lackey.

0:04:04.975 --> 0:04:07.071
True too.

0:04:09.748 --> 0:04:11.241
What is this,<br/>"make-Believe ballroom"?

0:04:11.317 --> 0:04:13.980
How many times you gonna<br/>change the stations?

0:04:16.688 --> 0:04:18.752
This "departed" soundtrack's<br/>fucking killer.

0:04:18.918 --> 0:04:20.750
<i>- You got it?<br/>- Yeah, it's good.</i>

0:04:23.995 --> 0:04:27.320
Regarding, Phil,<br/>I gotta ask:

0:04:27.426 --> 0:04:30.492
Whatever happened to<br/>"stop and smell the roses"?

0:04:32.498 --> 0:04:34.301
You're right.

0:04:34.365 --> 0:04:36.761
U're right.

0:04:36.937 --> 0:04:40.102
You can't fight every<br/>fucking battle, right?

0:04:41.605 --> 0:04:45.713
Asbestos...

0:04:56.286 --> 0:04:58.080
each day's a gift.

0:04:58.126 --> 0:05:00.722
Every time I look at my<br/>kid, that's what I realiz

0:05:00.866 --> 0:05:03.562
And that shit<br/>with Junior, please.

0:05:09.966 --> 0:05:13.302
Just that peoplike Phil,

0:05:13.476 --> 0:05:15.073
They're not<br/>on that page--

0:05:15.148 --> 0:05:18.141
Take those rosesand stick 'em up<br/>your ass, thorns first.

0:05:23.645 --> 0:05:26.652
<i>- This system's<br/>got no balls.</i>

0:05:55.917 --> 0:05:58.783
So how was your party<br/>that day at the hous

0:06:01.087 --> 0:06:03.220
Slow the fuck down,<br/>will ya?!

0:06:27.216 --> 0:06:28.611
Maybe you sh<br/>go back, heidi.

0:06:28.715 --> 0:06:30.982
Kennedy, I'm on my<br/>learner's permit after dark.

0:06:40.596 --> 0:06:43.223
Ton'...

0:06:45.236 --> 0:06:48.232
you gotta...<br/>help me.

0:06:48.405 --> 0:06:50.731
I'm coming.

0:06:53.005 --> 0:06:54.940
I'll never pass<br/>the drug test.

0:06:55.008 --> 0:06:57.511
What?

0:06:57.618 --> 0:06:59.640
You gotta get me out.

0:06:59.776 --> 0:07:01.812
I'll lose my license.

0:07:51.735 --> 0:07:54.901
Never pass a drug test.

0:07:54.967 --> 0:07:56.632
Call me a taxi.

0:09:22.556 --> 0:09:24.293
<i>911.</i>

0:09:24.397 --> 0:09:25.993
We've been<br/>in an accident.

0:09:26.127 --> 0:09:29.060
<i>Old pumping station road...</i>

0:09:29.228 --> 0:09:31.831
past the reservoir.

0:09:50.315 --> 0:09:51.851
Sorry about that.

0:09:51.956 --> 0:09:53.650
My friend...

0:09:53.786 --> 0:09:56.482
guy I came with,<br/>how is he?

0:09:56.626 --> 0:10:00.293
<i>Your friend is dead.<br/>Paramedics called it in the ambulance.</i>

0:10:00.428 --> 0:10:02.821
<i>Breathe in, please. Hold it.</i>

0:10:02.966 --> 0:10:05.590
Do you know a contact number<br/>for his next of kin?

0:10:06.667 --> 0:10:10.971
His wife.

0:10:22.147 --> 0:10:25.611
<i>- Hello.<br/>- Hello, may I speak with Carmela Soprano?</i>

0:10:25.687 --> 0:10:28.053
<i>- Who is this?<br/>- Nurse al rosario,</i>

0:10:28.155 --> 0:10:31.491
<i>St. Clare's hospital, denville.<br/>Is mrs. Soprano there?</i>

0:10:31.625 --> 0:10:33.493
Yes, this is<br/>mrs. Soprano.

0:10:33.626 --> 0:10:36.391
<i>I'm here with your husband.<br/>He'd like to speak with you.</i>

0:10:38.996 --> 0:10:42.501
<i>- Carm.<br/>- Tony, is everything okay?</i>

0:10:42.636 --> 0:10:44.033
<i>Are you sitting down?</i>

0:10:44.177 --> 0:10:46.401
<i>- I'm serious.<br/>- Yes, I'm in bed.</i>

0:10:46.508 --> 0:10:48.243
<i>All right, listen.</i>

0:10:48.348 --> 0:10:50.472
<i>Sweetheart,<br/>there's been an accident.</i>

0:10:51.977 --> 0:10:54.212
<i>We were coming back<br/>from the city and...</i>

0:10:55.517 --> 0:10:59.152
<i>- Christopher's dead.<br/>- Oh my God!</i>

0:10:59.215 --> 0:11:01.221
All right.

0:11:01.357 --> 0:11:03.652
- Carm.<br/>- What happened?

0:11:03.756 --> 0:11:07.362
He drove off the road<br/>and the car flipped over.

0:11:07.397 --> 0:11:09.991
<i>- I'll tell you in detail.<br/>- Are you okay?</i>

0:11:10.027 --> 0:11:11.992
I just banged my knee,<br/>the one from high school.

0:11:12.038 --> 0:11:14.032
I'm fine, but...

0:11:15.535 --> 0:11:17.233
he wasn't wearing<br/>a belt.

0:11:17.338 --> 0:11:19.171
Where are you,<br/>St. Clare's?

0:11:19.236 --> 0:11:23.043
Listen, they're gonna call<br/>kelli if they haven't already...

0:11:24.248 --> 0:11:26.173
just get al and rita<br/>on the phone

0:11:26.247 --> 0:11:28.013
And get 'em started<br/>over there.

0:11:28.046 --> 0:11:31.880
All right, all right.<br/>Oh my God, Tony, he's dead?

0:11:31.956 --> 0:11:34.011
Yeah.

0:11:34.055 --> 0:11:37.422
All right.<br/>L-Let me get dressed.

0:11:43.196 --> 0:11:45.233
Thank you.

0:12:09.887 --> 0:12:13.723
Mr. Tony,<br/>Mr. Sil is here.

0:12:13.797 --> 0:12:15.521
Okay.

0:12:15.566 --> 0:12:18.733
- Mrs. Carmela say you should stay in bed.<br/>- Have him come up.

0:12:18.796 --> 0:12:20.503
We're right here, Ton'.

0:12:20.566 --> 0:12:22.563
We came as soon<br/>as we heard.

0:12:24.336 --> 0:12:27.570
- Ton'.<br/>- Patsy went over to Chrissy's mom's house.

0:12:27.748 --> 0:12:30.141
- Yeah, that's where Carmela is.<br/>- Carlo's coming up.

0:12:30.245 --> 0:12:31.742
Yeah.

0:12:36.417 --> 0:12:38.983
- How you doing, Ton'?<br/>- My knee got banged up.

0:12:39.085 --> 0:12:41.081
<i>They said it's<br/>probably gonna be okay.</i>

0:12:42.607 --> 0:12:45.321
Last thing<br/>I remember was...

0:12:45.426 --> 0:12:47.362
we pulled away<br/>from Phil.

0:12:47.426 --> 0:12:49.922
Skid marks all over the<br/>place, the cops told Carm.

0:12:49.997 --> 0:12:52.992
He had a heavy foot,<br/>that kid, always.

0:12:53.098 --> 0:12:54.932
Almost put me through<br/>a billboard one time.

0:12:56.766 --> 0:12:59.002
- Hey, Ton'.<br/>- Come on in.

0:12:59.106 --> 0:13:01.400
I'm so sorry, Ton'.

0:13:01.475 --> 0:13:03.372
I still can't<br/>believe it.

0:13:03.508 --> 0:13:05.871
Thanks. I know<br/>you two were close.

0:13:05.946 --> 0:13:07.541
I was making<br/>my collections

0:13:07.716 --> 0:13:11.112
And Anthony maffei<br/>called me. Jesus.

0:13:15.887 --> 0:13:19.050
<i>It's carlo, I bet.</i>

0:13:19.157 --> 0:13:21.993
Fucking idiot didn't even<br/>have his seat belt on.

0:13:23.297 --> 0:13:26.063
His chest filled up.

0:13:27.237 --> 0:13:29.063
Suffocated<br/>on his own blood.

0:13:29.137 --> 0:13:31.971
- Oh, Jesus.<br/>- Jesus Christ.

0:13:32.076 --> 0:13:35.240
Seems like that's<br/>the cause of death.

0:13:37.148 --> 0:13:39.642
It's not carlo.<br/>I heard AJ.

0:13:39.718 --> 0:13:41.712
Carlo's coming up?

0:13:41.816 --> 0:13:43.912
What's with you and carlfucking arrival?

0:13:44.017 --> 0:13:47.451
- I'm just saying.<br/>- They're gonna do a full blood test on him.

0:13:47.485 --> 0:13:50.052
See, you know,

0:13:50.155 --> 0:13:53.390
If alcohol,

0:13:53.421 --> 0:13:56.898
- Drugs or...<br/>- It did occur to me.

0:13:57.034 --> 0:13:59.391
He didn't seem high,<br/>did he?

0:13:59.499 --> 0:14:01.360
Are you kidding?<br/>I would have been furi

0:14:01.439 --> 0:14:03.430
I would have fucking<br/>strangled him.

0:14:03.505 --> 0:14:05.901
He'd been working the program<br/>ever since he threw little Paulie

0:14:06.006 --> 0:14:08.841
- Out that window.<br/>- Let's not go there.

0:14:08.907 --> 0:14:11.212
Even before that<br/>he was battling that shit.

0:14:11.347 --> 0:14:13.172
He gave it his all.

0:14:13.348 --> 0:14:16.610
Well, anyway,<br/>he's gone now,

0:14:16.686 --> 0:14:18.682
Our Chrissy.

0:14:20.086 --> 0:14:21.683
Crazy fucking maniac.

0:14:24.396 --> 0:14:25.850
The thing to take<br/>to heart, t,

0:14:26.027 --> 0:14:27.993
You're here.<br/>You're all right.

0:14:28.027 --> 0:14:30.021
You could have been killed,<br/>for ck's sake.

0:14:30.197 --> 0:14:32.432
What are you gonna do?

0:14:35.867 --> 0:14:37.303
Thanks.

0:14:37.378 --> 0:14:39.701
Whoa.<br/>What are you doing?

0:14:39.806 --> 0:14:42.202
No no no, I gotta<br/>try and get up.

0:14:42.278 --> 0:14:45.743
Gotta go and meet Carm<br/>over at Chrissy's.

0:14:45.816 --> 0:14:47.883
Kelli and all that.

0:14:49.615 --> 0:14:51.380
I'll make you<br/>a plate.

0:14:51.456 --> 0:14:53.980
- Get me a scotch.<br/>- Are you serious?

0:14:54.057 --> 0:14:56.821
Yeah, and have<br/>one yourself.

0:15:00.565 --> 0:15:03.793
They were close,<br/>two cousins.

0:15:08.765 --> 0:15:10.573
You all right?

0:15:11.907 --> 0:15:14.671
I know I had my<br/>differences with that kid,

0:15:14.745 --> 0:15:18.170
But maybe I didn't<br/>do right by him, neither.

0:15:18.248 --> 0:15:20.680
If you were his dad,<br/>I was his dutch uncle,

0:15:20.748 --> 0:15:24.111
And what the fuck did<br/>I do but get pissed off,

0:15:24.188 --> 0:15:27.920
Fight with him over<br/>cocksucking fucking money?

0:15:28.027 --> 0:15:30.922
I'd break his balls when<br/>he ied not to have a drink

0:15:30.997 --> 0:15:33.020
Or a little taste<br/>of snow.

0:15:33.125 --> 0:15:35.763
It's over, Paulie.

0:15:41.166 --> 0:15:43.673
Did anybody ever hear<br/>from the hospital?

0:15:43.778 --> 0:15:46.002
I was waiting<br/>till kelli woke up.

0:15:47.478 --> 0:15:50.372
They found cocaine<br/>in his blood.

0:15:50.445 --> 0:15:53.512
- Madonn'.<br/>- 'Cause of death was a hemothorax.

0:15:53.547 --> 0:15:56.612
Yeah, airbags can crush the ribs<br/>when there's no other restraint.

0:15:56.785 --> 0:15:59.611
They said he might<br/>have made it,

0:15:59.785 --> 0:16:00.950
But he didn't.

0:16:01.058 --> 0:16:02.850
Couldn't have worn<br/>his goddamn seat belt?

0:16:02.957 --> 0:16:05.323
- No wonder. He was<br/>whack-A-Doo. - Al, just stop it.

0:16:05.357 --> 0:16:08.391
Aw, baloney. He leaves<br/>our granddaughter fatherless.

0:16:09.798 --> 0:16:11.963
My only child!

0:16:12.066 --> 0:16:14.300
Drinking won't help,<br/>honey.

0:16:14.368 --> 0:16:16.303
Jesus Christ.

0:16:20.308 --> 0:16:22.873
Look at this.<br/>Syracuse is losing.

0:16:27.888 --> 0:16:29.783
I don't know<br/>what to say.

0:16:29.886 --> 0:16:32.310
- What?<br/>- I just got a call from little Paulie.

0:16:33.285 --> 0:16:35.152
Nucci gualtieri died.

0:16:37.025 --> 0:16:39.622
Stroke on the bus back<br/>to the home.

0:16:39.697 --> 0:16:42.192
They had gone<br/>to see "Jersey boys."

0:16:44.938 --> 0:16:47.600
This is difficult.

0:16:47.708 --> 0:16:50.501
This is pain

0:16:50.677 --> 0:16:52.371
Like I'm not used to.

0:16:52.405 --> 0:16:55.771
We've said before he was<br/>like a son in some ways.

0:16:55.877 --> 0:16:58.041
To see him die<br/>like that...

0:16:59.048 --> 0:17:00.712
practically<br/>in my arms.

0:17:00.785 --> 0:17:04.351
He was just starting<br/>his life.

0:17:04.516 --> 0:17:07.353
Yeah.

0:17:15.396 --> 0:17:17.133
You know what?

0:17:18.538 --> 0:17:21.300
- This is bullshit.<br/>- What?

0:17:21.408 --> 0:17:24.033
I haven't been able<br/>to tell anybody this, but...

0:17:25.806 --> 0:17:27.942
I'm fucking relieved.

0:17:28.045 --> 0:17:29.871
Really?

0:17:29.977 --> 0:17:31.972
He was a tremendous drag<br/>on my emotions,

0:17:32.046 --> 0:17:35.583
On my... thoughts<br/>about the future.

0:17:36.887 --> 0:17:38.850
Every morning<br/>I wake up thinking,

0:17:38.886 --> 0:17:41.050
"Is today the day that<br/>one of my best friends

0:17:41.125 --> 0:17:43.221
Is gonna dime me<br/>to the FBI?"

0:17:43.428 --> 0:17:45.623
And a weak,<br/>fucking sniveling,

0:17:45.657 --> 0:17:48.162
Lying drug addict? That's<br/>the worst kind of bet.

0:17:48.225 --> 0:17:51.230
The biggest blunder<br/>of my career

0:17:51.297 --> 0:17:53.531
Is now gone.

0:17:53.567 --> 0:17:57.072
And I don't have to be<br/>confronted by that fact no more.

0:17:58.237 --> 0:18:00.371
And as a relative,<br/>a friend,

0:18:00.406 --> 0:18:03.403
Someone you can<br/>count on...

0:18:04.915 --> 0:18:06.770
I see.

0:18:11.617 --> 0:18:13.550
Let me tell you<br/>something:

0:18:13.658 --> 0:18:16.882
I've murdered friends<br/>before, even relatives--

0:18:17.028 --> 0:18:19.352
My cousin Tony,

0:18:19.458 --> 0:18:21.923
My best friend--<br/>Puss.

0:18:23.625 --> 0:18:27.462
But this...

0:18:32.036 --> 0:18:34.443
was I talking<br/>in my sleep?

0:18:34.546 --> 0:18:36.803
Snoring.

0:18:36.878 --> 0:18:38.611
I'm gonna put on the TV<br/>if you don't mind.

0:18:38.677 --> 0:18:41.480
I can't stay asleep<br/>either. I'm all...

0:18:47.486 --> 0:18:50.391
I mean, I can laugh and cry,<br/>and I could always get the part.

0:18:50.498 --> 0:18:53.222
- First time?<br/>- First time. Never can keep it.

0:18:53.358 --> 0:18:55.490
They got onto me<br/>after a while.

0:18:55.627 --> 0:18:58.263
I'd lose my voice, fall<br/>down, get red in the face,

0:18:58.365 --> 0:19:01.001
Talk too fast<br/>and couldn't act.

0:19:31.265 --> 0:19:33.732
Can you make me<br/>a cappuccino?

0:19:33.836 --> 0:19:36.830
That fucking machine from Paulie,<br/>you need a pilot's license.

0:19:40.606 --> 0:19:43.573
It's so hard not to think of<br/>Christopher as a child, isn't it?

0:19:43.617 --> 0:19:47.041
Caity kind of looks likeim,<br/>which makes it doubly hard

0:19:48.618 --> 0:19:50.911
Of course that's not<br/>gonna do her any favors

0:19:51.018 --> 0:19:53.552
When she hits puberty--<br/>That schnoz.

0:19:53.618 --> 0:19:56.182
A lot of women<br/>found him very attractive.

0:19:58.556 --> 0:20:01.293
I think to myself,

0:20:01.466 --> 0:20:05.190
How could I have ever said<br/>those things about him,

0:20:05.308 --> 0:20:09.030
About him and adriana, what<br/>her mother said he did to her?

0:20:15.106 --> 0:20:17.410
Obviously he was violent as an adult.

0:20:17.478 --> 0:20:21.143
His upbringing,<br/>but he adored Ade.

0:20:21.285 --> 0:20:23.750
He could never let<br/>himself take her life.

0:20:25.715 --> 0:20:27.382
Why are we<br/>so quick to blame?

0:20:27.485 --> 0:20:29.123
What is<br/>the attraction in that?

0:20:43.065 --> 0:20:45.073
It's good.

0:20:45.108 --> 0:20:47.071
Thank you.

0:20:49.145 --> 0:20:52.240
When I called you...

0:20:52.315 --> 0:20:53.943
the night after<br/>the accident,

0:20:54.085 --> 0:20:55.813
And you asked me,

0:20:55.915 --> 0:20:58.652
"Oh my God, Tony,<br/>he's dead?"

0:20:58.755 --> 0:21:00.851
Yeah.

0:21:00.926 --> 0:21:03.150
And I thought--

0:21:03.255 --> 0:21:06.152
Well, I thought<br/>I picked up a twinge of...

0:21:09.665 --> 0:21:11.590
- relief.<br/>- What?

0:21:11.667 --> 0:21:13.261
It just seemed like--<br/>I don't know--

0:21:13.336 --> 0:21:15.662
How could you say that? You don't<br/>know what you're talking about.

0:21:15.805 --> 0:21:17.103
Okay, good, I'm wrong.

0:21:17.206 --> 0:21:19.102
Maybe if you did pick up<br/>something like that,

0:21:19.207 --> 0:21:21.341
Maybe it's because<br/>I warelieved...

0:21:21.478 --> 0:21:23.373
that it was him<br/>and not you.

0:21:23.477 --> 0:21:26.371
Well, don't feel bad about<br/>that. That makes sense.

0:21:29.386 --> 0:21:32.151
To be going down<br/>to the hospital again

0:21:32.216 --> 0:21:34.222
At 2:00 in the morning?

0:21:39.395 --> 0:21:41.623
And you know what?<br/>When you were shot,

0:21:41.696 --> 0:21:43.962
It was Christopher<br/>who held me.

0:21:48.806 --> 0:21:51.701
You know<br/>the baby's car seat?

0:21:53.205 --> 0:21:55.871
A giant tree branch<br/>came through the window

0:21:55.906 --> 0:21:57.911
And demolished it.

0:22:00.487 --> 0:22:03.310
She would have<br/>been dead, caitlin,

0:22:03.418 --> 0:22:05.481
Mangled beyond<br/>recognition.

0:22:18.395 --> 0:22:20.292
I told her about<br/>the baby seat

0:22:20.407 --> 0:22:22.331
So she wouldn't<br/>feel so rotten.

0:22:22.406 --> 0:22:25.031
I mean, he was high as a fucking<br/>kite. I didn't tell her that.

0:22:25.076 --> 0:22:28.600
In retrospect,<br/>maybe not the best approach.

0:22:28.676 --> 0:22:32.410
Right,<br/>I'm the asshole... again.

0:22:34.048 --> 0:22:36.443
What?

0:22:38.187 --> 0:22:40.011
No, go ahead.

0:22:41.586 --> 0:22:44.693
It's amazing<br/>how things work.

0:22:44.795 --> 0:22:48.260
His mother,<br/>cousin joanne,

0:22:48.368 --> 0:22:50.023
A lush.

0:22:50.128 --> 0:22:52.962
Totally abandoned him<br/>as a parent,

0:22:53.038 --> 0:22:55.763
But now she's reaping<br/>all the sympathy

0:22:55.866 --> 0:22:57.973
And the tears.

0:22:58.138 --> 0:23:00.701
How are you doing,<br/>Anthony?

0:23:02.546 --> 0:23:05.211
There have been<br/>some hard moments.

0:23:07.215 --> 0:23:09.543
But a weak,<br/>lying drug at

0:23:09.648 --> 0:23:11.612
Who fantasized<br/>about my downfall,

0:23:11.657 --> 0:23:14.052
Who even showed people<br/>his filthy thoughts

0:23:14.157 --> 0:23:16.151
On a movie screen...?

0:23:18.125 --> 0:23:21.120
Let me tell you something:<br/>I've seen friends die before,

0:23:21.225 --> 0:23:23.793
Accidents,

0:23:23.896 --> 0:23:25.962
Even murder.

0:23:26.065 --> 0:23:28.063
My cousin Tony,<br/>they shot his face away.

0:23:28.165 --> 0:23:31.501
And I was fucking<br/>prostate with grief.

0:23:31.606 --> 0:23:33.133
But this?

0:23:34.348 --> 0:23:36.340
I see.

0:23:36.447 --> 0:23:38.642
And it occurs to me,<br/>I hand-Carried this kid

0:23:38.678 --> 0:23:41.180
Through the worst<br/>crisis he ever had.

0:23:43.185 --> 0:23:46.450
I can't go<br/>into particulars, but...

0:23:46.616 --> 0:23:48.781
wives, girlfriends,

0:23:48.928 --> 0:23:50.691
They can complicate life<br/>in a major way.

0:23:50.855 --> 0:23:52.992
I don't have to<br/>tell you that.

0:23:56.326 --> 0:23:59.293
Anyway, huge problem<br/>of his own making.

0:24:01.508 --> 0:24:04.302
And he cried.<br/>He couldn't deal with it.

0:24:04.375 --> 0:24:06.102
So...

0:24:06.138 --> 0:24:08.970
I took up the slack.<br/>I handled it.

0:24:09.106 --> 0:24:11.043
I felt sorry<br/>for him.

0:24:12.478 --> 0:24:14.341
Now he talked gratitude...

0:24:16.046 --> 0:24:17.680
but guess what py<br/>produces in the recipient.

0:24:17.787 --> 0:24:19.883
<i>They shit<br/>on your pity.</i>

0:24:21.558 --> 0:24:24.522
That's what broke<br/>the camel's back.

0:24:24.625 --> 0:24:28.291
How are you<br/>handling all this?

0:24:28.367 --> 0:24:30.792
The worst part,<br/>truthfully,

0:24:30.895 --> 0:24:33.063
Is I gotta sit there

0:24:33.168 --> 0:24:36.630
Withple<br/>who are hurting... bad.

0:24:37.838 --> 0:24:41.002
And I gotta have<br/>the long face

0:24:41.076 --> 0:24:44.010
And the sighing<br/>and the platitudes.

0:24:45.576 --> 0:24:47.540
But I don't feel it.

0:24:50.248 --> 0:24:52.510
Then that makes me feel<br/>like a hypocrite.

0:24:54.686 --> 0:24:57.052
And that makes<br/>me mad at them.

0:25:20.047 --> 0:25:22.281
Oh, hi.

0:25:22.348 --> 0:25:24.951
How are you?

0:25:30.027 --> 0:25:31.422
Julianna skiffle,

0:25:31.525 --> 0:25:34.263
This is my wife<br/>Carmela Soprano.

0:25:34.397 --> 0:25:35.721
Skiff.

0:25:35.868 --> 0:25:37.933
Oh, yeah, right.

0:25:38.065 --> 0:25:41.732
Julianna's a real estate<br/>agent in the old neighborhood.

0:25:41.805 --> 0:25:43.703
And you knew<br/>Christopher?

0:25:43.807 --> 0:25:45.473
I used to buy my meat<br/>at Satriale's.

0:25:49.106 --> 0:25:52.443
I'm a recovering addict.

0:25:53.715 --> 0:25:56.441
- I owe him a lot.<br/>- That's nice to hear.

0:25:58.917 --> 0:26:02.053
- Well, what are you gonna do, huh?<br/>- Nothing you can do.

0:26:02.088 --> 0:26:04.550
That's my point.

0:26:04.626 --> 0:26:06.253
He was too young.

0:26:08.827 --> 0:26:10.890
Good-Looking woman.

0:26:30.987 --> 0:26:33.252
They did<br/>a beautiful job on him.

0:26:40.365 --> 0:26:42.591
Oh, I'm gonna go up.

0:26:43.865 --> 0:26:46.662
I'll go up later,

0:26:46.766 --> 0:26:49.663
Give my seat to someone<br/>in the meantime.

0:26:54.478 --> 0:26:56.472
How are you doing?

0:26:59.178 --> 0:27:02.210
- It's tough.<br/>- Yeah.

0:27:02.317 --> 0:27:04.481
He loved y so much.

0:27:05.786 --> 0:27:08.380
- Yeah?<br/>- Well, you know he did.

0:27:14.328 --> 0:27:16.393
I'll go up later.

0:27:33.216 --> 0:27:36.482
There she is.<br/>3 to 5, 7 to 9.

0:27:36.587 --> 0:27:38.153
<i>Why do they call her that?</i>

0:27:38.215 --> 0:27:39.752
She never<br/>misses a wake.

0:27:45.095 --> 0:27:46.491
Oh, lord, oh, lord!

0:27:46.557 --> 0:27:48.561
Fucking<br/>James brown now.

0:27:51.738 --> 0:27:53.930
I'm serious.<br/>I can't take it.

0:27:54.005 --> 0:27:57.501
It's all right.<br/>We're here for you.

0:27:57.575 --> 0:28:00.100
Oh my God.<br/>Look at this.

0:28:04.347 --> 0:28:07.512
- Like a movie star.<br/>- Jackie kennedy.

0:28:25.768 --> 0:28:28.300
- I'm sorry for the loss of your cousin, bro.<br/>- Thanks.

0:28:28.407 --> 0:28:31.470
Me too, bro, me too.

0:28:31.576 --> 0:28:33.701
He was a good guy.

0:28:33.775 --> 0:28:37.112
Hey, don't let<br/>this linger

0:28:37.245 --> 0:28:38.513
On your head now.

0:28:38.717 --> 0:28:39.811
You know what<br/>I'm talking about.

0:28:51.656 --> 0:28:53.323
You know that night,

0:28:53.425 --> 0:28:55.593
A tree limb came in<br/>through the car window,

0:28:55.666 --> 0:28:59.062
Completely destroyed<br/>the baby seat.

0:28:59.138 --> 0:29:01.300
Tony.

0:29:01.437 --> 0:29:04.303
You guys are gonna<br/>hang in a while, right?

0:29:04.435 --> 0:29:07.073
We really should make an<br/>appearance at the other wake.

0:29:26.496 --> 0:29:28.792
Are we that late?

0:29:28.865 --> 0:29:30.662
Glad you came.

0:29:30.798 --> 0:29:32.930
- He'll appreciate it.<br/>- Oh, please.

0:29:48.988 --> 0:29:50.810
I gotta<br/>get out of here.

0:29:54.985 --> 0:29:56.953
- Paul.<br/>- Ton'.

0:29:57.998 --> 0:29:59.993
Thanks for coming.

0:30:01.625 --> 0:30:03.732
We are so sorry<br/>for your loss, Paulie.

0:30:03.795 --> 0:30:05.860
How you hangin' in,<br/>paolucc'?

0:30:05.995 --> 0:30:07.402
As well as can be expected.

0:30:07.506 --> 0:30:09.161
Must be very<br/>hard for you.

0:30:09.236 --> 0:30:11.172
I know how close the two<br/>of you had become again

0:30:11.235 --> 0:30:12.671
Yeah.

0:30:12.807 --> 0:30:14.473
Not much<br/>of a sendoff here.

0:30:14.508 --> 0:30:17.810
- The room is beautiful, Paulie.<br/>- Nobody's in it.

0:30:17.875 --> 0:30:19.573
What kind<br/>of testament is this

0:30:19.677 --> 0:30:21.340
To the spirit and<br/>generosity of the woman?

0:30:21.415 --> 0:30:23.083
We're here<br/>for you, Paulie.

0:30:23.188 --> 0:30:24.811
You know that.

0:30:24.885 --> 0:30:26.350
Okay.

0:30:31.328 --> 0:30:33.321
It's a fundamental<br/>lack of respect

0:30:33.355 --> 0:30:35.223
And I'm never gonna<br/>fuckin' forget it, neither.

0:30:35.365 --> 0:30:38.263
Jesus, Paulie, people your<br/>mother's age, their friends die off.

0:30:38.368 --> 0:30:40.163
What, she outlived<br/>sil? Carlo?

0:30:40.305 --> 0:30:41.862
They're all over there<br/>at your nephew's.

0:30:42.007 --> 0:30:44.533
- Yeah, but-- - Councilman<br/>carillo was here three minutes.

0:30:44.607 --> 0:30:46.173
I clocked him.

0:30:48.546 --> 0:30:51.372
People are comin'<br/>and they don't, fuck 'em.

0:30:51.415 --> 0:30:53.740
I got 500 prayer cards.

0:30:53.888 --> 0:30:55.113
Well, Carm and I aere.

0:30:55.188 --> 0:30:56.340
What the fuck<br/>is that? Nothin'?

0:30:57.617 --> 0:30:59.181
No, Ton', of course not.

0:30:59.255 --> 0:31:01.883
- Means the world.<br/>- Okay.

0:31:03.588 --> 0:31:05.350
She suffered too,<br/>you know.

0:31:05.428 --> 0:31:08.063
Yeah, well, this isn't<br/>the time or the place.

0:31:08.196 --> 0:31:09.963
You're right.

0:31:13.366 --> 0:31:15.031
How have you been<br/>dealing witht?

0:31:15.066 --> 0:31:17.973
It's really sad but it's<br/>kinda the same as with blanca.

0:31:18.038 --> 0:31:21.172
I mean, I don't really just keep<br/>thinking about things the way I did--

0:31:21.205 --> 0:31:23.342
Over and over,<br/>you know?

0:31:23.377 --> 0:31:26.372
Well, for one thing,<br/>perhaps the meds are working.

0:31:27.987 --> 0:31:29.643
Did you finally enroll?

0:31:29.785 --> 0:31:31.713
I'm in a few classes

0:31:31.887 --> 0:31:34.220
Unofficially, until my<br/>transcript clears from ramapo.

0:31:34.326 --> 0:31:36.322
Beginning english.

0:31:36.388 --> 0:31:38.893
Oh, and I went<br/>to a class on the history

0:31:39.055 --> 0:31:40.793
Of the israeli-Palestinian<br/>conflict.

0:31:40.926 --> 0:31:44.062
- Wow.<br/>- I mean, it's hard to pick up in the middle.

0:31:44.166 --> 0:31:46.333
I might take it<br/>xt semester.

0:31:46.397 --> 0:31:48.661
I mean, it's so<br/>dicked-Up over there

0:31:48.806 --> 0:31:51.103
And no one knows<br/>who started it.

0:31:51.178 --> 0:31:52.803
- Are you sleeping?<br/>- What? In class?

0:31:52.977 --> 0:31:56.100
No. You were having<br/>trouble, remember?

0:31:58.075 --> 0:32:00.442
Wellbutrin xl<br/>kicks ass.

0:32:00.518 --> 0:32:02.940
I'm hearing good things<br/>about the lexapro.

0:32:02.986 --> 0:32:05.083
Check it, paisan.<br/>Long John shithead.

0:32:08.055 --> 0:32:10.181
That kid's in my<br/>south American lit class.

0:32:10.288 --> 0:32:12.351
He had his toes amputated.

0:32:17.298 --> 0:32:19.131
He said it was an accident<br/>with his car battery.

0:32:19.165 --> 0:32:20.800
Acid burned right<br/>through his shoe.

0:32:36.718 --> 0:32:39.353
Oh, you litt<br/>shfooyadell.

0:32:39.488 --> 0:32:41.123
She should nurse.

0:32:42.155 --> 0:32:43.890
At least somebody<br/>feels like eating.

0:32:45.355 --> 0:32:47.660
She doesn't know.

0:32:47.725 --> 0:32:49.761
Isn't God wonderful<br/>that way?

0:32:59.907 --> 0:33:02.970
<i>- Hello?<br/>- Alan, it's Tony. You busy?</i>

0:33:03.076 --> 0:33:04.713
Usual shit--<br/>Some Japanese guy

0:33:04.817 --> 0:33:07.142
Got his suit ruined<br/>at cirque du soleil.

0:33:07.185 --> 0:33:09.983
<i>- Listen, I need a suite.<br/>- So all the guys coming out?</i>

0:33:10.085 --> 0:33:11.880
No no. I'm solo.

0:33:11.986 --> 0:33:14.853
Oh. We'll see what<br/>we can do about that.

0:33:15.026 --> 0:33:18.093
<i>Look, I just want to-<br/>Peace and quiet...</i>

0:33:18.228 --> 0:33:20.720
- ...chill out.<br/>- You set for transpo?

0:33:20.826 --> 0:33:23.192
<i>I'll be happy<br/>to send a plane.</i>

0:33:58.367 --> 0:33:59.592
No more bets.

0:34:02.035 --> 0:34:05.033
33 black odd.

0:34:15.217 --> 0:34:16.411
No more bets.

0:34:18.918 --> 0:34:21.921
Five red odd.

0:34:56.086 --> 0:34:58.153
It's hard to imagine<br/>for a poet,

0:34:58.258 --> 0:35:01.692
But wordsworth<br/>was as rich and popular

0:35:01.797 --> 0:35:03.460
As, say, someone like

0:35:03.596 --> 0:35:05.963
<i>John grisham nowadays.</i>

0:35:06.037 --> 0:35:08.101
But wordsworth writes

0:35:08.206 --> 0:35:10.830
"The world is<br/>too much with us."

0:35:10.937 --> 0:35:13.202
Later, he invokes<br/>nature again.

0:35:14.847 --> 0:35:18.342
Why such strong words<br/>against the material world?

0:36:02.585 --> 0:36:05.422
That was fast.

0:36:05.525 --> 0:36:07.261
The gatehouse<br/>usually gives

0:36:07.396 --> 0:36:09.391
Shitty directions to<br/>the east tower. Come in.

0:36:11.767 --> 0:36:13.702
<i>So...</i>

0:36:14.935 --> 0:36:18.000
you're a friend<br/>of Chris.

0:36:18.076 --> 0:36:20.373
Yeah...<br/>Tony, by the way.

0:36:20.478 --> 0:36:22.241
No, I know.

0:36:22.346 --> 0:36:23.872
He's mentioned you,<br/>actually.

0:36:23.946 --> 0:36:26.572
Well, I heard nothing<br/>but nice things about you.

0:36:27.948 --> 0:36:31.513
Except... you're more<br/>beautiful than he let on.

0:36:31.616 --> 0:36:33.680
<i>- Really?<br/>- Talked about ya...</i>

0:36:33.756 --> 0:36:36.682
a few times, told me more<br/>than once to look you up.

0:36:36.757 --> 0:36:38.092
Did he?

0:36:39.527 --> 0:36:41.292
Well well well.

0:36:44.538 --> 0:36:46.131
You want a drink<br/>or something?

0:36:46.267 --> 0:36:48.961
I got some pinot grigio<br/>in the fridge.

0:36:54.806 --> 0:36:57.440
I got some, uh...

0:36:57.546 --> 0:36:59.640
serious news.

0:36:59.716 --> 0:37:02.043
- Uh-Oh.<br/>- It's about Christopher.

0:37:03.546 --> 0:37:05.712
- He's dead.<br/>- At?

0:37:06.887 --> 0:37:08.550
It was a car accident,

0:37:08.658 --> 0:37:10.823
Happened<br/>a couple days ago.

0:37:14.066 --> 0:37:15.891
Oh my God.

0:37:16.898 --> 0:37:19.060
That's fucking awful.

0:37:19.236 --> 0:37:21.031
I'm sorry.

0:37:21.068 --> 0:37:24.431
- What happened?<br/>- Bad wreck...

0:37:24.507 --> 0:37:26.631
high-Speed...

0:37:28.178 --> 0:37:29.800
he was killed instantly.

0:37:29.907 --> 0:37:31.811
Somehow, I walked away.

0:37:31.918 --> 0:37:33.942
Jesus, that must<br/>have been scary.

0:37:34.017 --> 0:37:37.250
The fuckin' sound alone...

0:37:37.316 --> 0:37:39.912
did he ever...

0:37:40.088 --> 0:37:42.583
marry that one girl--The one wh-

0:37:42.655 --> 0:37:44.350
No.

0:37:45.426 --> 0:37:47.262
Found a real sweetheart,<br/>though-- Kelli--

0:37:47.365 --> 0:37:49.260
And...

0:37:49.365 --> 0:37:51.030
they just had<br/>a baby girl.

0:37:51.097 --> 0:37:53.090
Maybe that's good,<br/>you know?

0:37:54.507 --> 0:37:57.771
I mean,<br/>bad that he left her,

0:37:57.878 --> 0:38:00.671
But good that he--<br/>He left something.

0:38:06.447 --> 0:38:08.611
I thought<br/>you should know.

0:38:13.685 --> 0:38:15.622
Well, um...

0:38:18.798 --> 0:38:21.290
extremely cool, you coming<br/>over here. I appreciate that.

0:38:23.396 --> 0:38:25.731
- How long you here for?<br/>- I don't know.

0:38:25.797 --> 0:38:28.800
Just play it as I go.

0:38:49.156 --> 0:38:51.322
<i>- What's up?<br/>- It's stefano.</i>

0:38:51.397 --> 0:38:54.262
Look, I'm sorry to bother you,<br/>but I'm here at the school.

0:38:54.398 --> 0:38:56.092
<i>The asbestos,<br/>it's backing up.</i>

0:38:56.166 --> 0:38:57.990
<i>I've gotta dump<br/>this shit.</i>

0:38:58.165 --> 0:39:00.262
<i>It's not wrapped to code and<br/>all the other violations--</i>

0:39:00.337 --> 0:39:03.161
- Yeah?<br/>- I could get nailed big time.

0:39:03.237 --> 0:39:05.201
We're workin' on it, John.

0:39:05.336 --> 0:39:06.771
I'm trying<br/>to negotiate it out,

0:39:06.835 --> 0:39:08.442
But the asshole's<br/>taking a hard line for now.

0:39:08.477 --> 0:39:11.011
Just hang in there,<br/>let me do my thing.

0:39:11.116 --> 0:39:12.941
All right.

0:39:18.755 --> 0:39:20.351
- Whoa.<br/>- Jeff'll clean it up.

0:39:20.428 --> 0:39:22.223
Make him clean it<br/>in his bare feet.

0:39:22.286 --> 0:39:25.353
I got the venison steaks!

0:39:25.525 --> 0:39:29.422
Oh!

0:39:29.565 --> 0:39:31.593
Oh!

0:39:32.766 --> 0:39:35.202
What the fuck?<br/>You blind?

0:39:35.367 --> 0:39:38.003
Me?! You open the door,<br/>you don't look at all.

0:39:38.108 --> 0:39:40.072
Aw, shit, you wrecked<br/>my fuckin' door.

0:39:40.135 --> 0:39:42.370
- You did that to your own door!<br/>- Whoa whoa whoa.

0:39:42.476 --> 0:39:44.042
What the fuck<br/>did you say?

0:39:44.118 --> 0:39:46.311
I said he opened the door,<br/>he don't look at all.

0:39:46.415 --> 0:39:48.082
Look at my fuckin' bike!

0:39:48.147 --> 0:39:50.011
- Do you hear this guy?<br/>- You saw it!

0:39:50.118 --> 0:39:52.651
Fuck you, nigger.

0:39:54.657 --> 0:39:56.150
I am not a nigger!

0:39:56.286 --> 0:39:58.651
I am from somalia!<br/>I go to school and I work!

0:39:58.756 --> 0:40:00.220
Do not call me<br/>a nigger!

0:40:00.326 --> 0:40:02.323
So you're some<br/>terrorist piece of shit.

0:40:02.395 --> 0:40:05.061
Either way, motherfucker,<br/>you're in the wrong neighborhood.

0:40:05.136 --> 0:40:06.892
Get the fuck away!

0:40:08.666 --> 0:40:10.500
You a tough nigger now?!

0:40:10.578 --> 0:40:12.502
You got something to say?

0:40:14.307 --> 0:40:16.741
<i>Cocksucker!</i>

0:40:57.215 --> 0:41:00.252
Do you mind?

0:41:00.315 --> 0:41:03.380
No, knock yourself out.

0:41:06.626 --> 0:41:09.393
This is the--

0:41:09.496 --> 0:41:12.030
This is the new shit--

0:41:12.138 --> 0:41:14.660
Medical-Grade, mellow,

0:41:14.737 --> 0:41:16.731
Paranoia-Free.

0:41:19.005 --> 0:41:21.703
Oh, well, that's good.

0:41:28.216 --> 0:41:31.482
Oh, Chris loved<br/>to party.

0:41:31.586 --> 0:41:33.983
What's your point?

0:41:34.056 --> 0:41:36.980
Nothing.<br/>You just...

0:41:37.057 --> 0:41:39.822
remind me<br/>of him, obviously.

0:41:41.825 --> 0:41:44.161
What's that mean?<br/>I fuck like him?

0:41:47.438 --> 0:41:50.001
So much<br/>for paranoia-Free.

0:41:50.107 --> 0:41:52.600
No, you were his<br/>friend, that's all.

0:41:52.677 --> 0:41:55.173
Why would you<br/>bring him up?

0:41:55.245 --> 0:41:58.010
All I'm saying

0:41:58.076 --> 0:41:59.613
Is that there's<br/>a certain kind of guy

0:41:59.677 --> 0:42:01.942
That I don't run into<br/>on campus.

0:42:02.016 --> 0:42:04.413
But where I dance--

0:42:04.555 --> 0:42:07.183
That accent,<br/>the clothes.

0:42:07.286 --> 0:42:08.852
I'm a type?

0:42:09.028 --> 0:42:11.693
This coming from the girl who's<br/>stripping her way through college?

0:42:11.798 --> 0:42:14.523
Actually,<br/>you're a surprise.

0:42:14.626 --> 0:42:16.691
Chris sometimes talked<br/>about some sad shit,

0:42:16.868 --> 0:42:19.033
But you seem--<br/>I don't know--

0:42:20.737 --> 0:42:22.132
Actually sad.

0:42:22.207 --> 0:42:25.132
Not right now I'm not.

0:42:25.206 --> 0:42:27.873
Jesus, this is some<br/>pretty fucking amazing dope.

0:42:29.807 --> 0:42:32.612
Chris said you two...

0:42:32.716 --> 0:42:34.410
took peyote together.

0:42:34.487 --> 0:42:36.481
Yeah.

0:42:36.586 --> 0:42:40.153
I mean, I haven't done<br/>buttons in a while, though.

0:42:45.427 --> 0:42:47.920
You know, I've been thinking<br/>why the fuck I'm here.

0:42:47.995 --> 0:42:49.823
You can get<br/>to that place.

0:42:49.966 --> 0:42:52.932
No. No, I mean Vegas.

0:42:52.997 --> 0:42:56.001
<i>Truth is I always wanted<br/>to try that shit...</i>

0:42:57.635 --> 0:42:59.802
but I always had

0:42:59.937 --> 0:43:02.803
All the responsibilities.

0:43:07.085 --> 0:43:09.910
You're a hard man<br/>to reach.

0:43:09.987 --> 0:43:11.851
Nobody's seen hide<br/>nor hair.

0:43:11.918 --> 0:43:13.782
Yeah, I'm away.<br/>What do you want?

0:43:13.886 --> 0:43:15.723
<i>What do I want?<br/>I'm returning your call.</i>

0:43:15.827 --> 0:43:17.552
I think this got nothing<br/>to do with asbestos.

0:43:17.628 --> 0:43:20.290
Why don't you let go of the<br/>old shit and be a businessman?

0:43:20.367 --> 0:43:22.961
- You got everything you want.<br/>- Not everything.

0:43:23.025 --> 0:43:26.593
But listen, allow me<br/>to express my condolences

0:43:26.766 --> 0:43:28.600
Regarding your nephew.

0:43:28.708 --> 0:43:30.161
This is me hanging up.

0:43:39.818 --> 0:43:42.482
- I can tell you're upset.<br/>- Big fucking deal.

0:43:42.548 --> 0:43:46.512
- What exactly happened this week?<br/>- Nothing.

0:43:48.226 --> 0:43:51.951
You know, people walk around<br/>like this is all something.

0:43:51.998 --> 0:43:54.292
They'rfucking laughing

0:43:54.365 --> 0:43:56.190
And nobody takes<br/>even one second

0:43:56.326 --> 0:43:58.061
To think about<br/>what's really going on.

0:43:58.166 --> 0:44:00.130
You sound<br/>depressed again.

0:44:00.197 --> 0:44:03.403
How can anybody not be?<br/>You'd have to be fucking nuts

0:44:03.535 --> 0:44:05.331
Not to be.

0:44:05.408 --> 0:44:08.302
I mean, you'd have to have<br/>your head wedged so far

0:44:08.376 --> 0:44:10.302
Up your ass that all<br/>you could see

0:44:10.377 --> 0:44:12.541
Is your own stupid face.

0:44:12.675 --> 0:44:14.480
What specifically<br/>are you talking about?

0:44:14.545 --> 0:44:18.150
I mean, everything<br/>is so fucked up.

0:44:22.086 --> 0:44:24.923
Why can't we all<br/>just get along?

0:44:30.965 --> 0:44:33.803
You don't have to<br/>chew it.

0:44:35.307 --> 0:44:37.471
You just wash it down<br/>like a pill.

0:46:45.367 --> 0:46:48.460
It's the same principle<br/>as the solar system.

0:46:55.148 --> 0:46:58.473
No more bets.

0:47:00.386 --> 0:47:03.081
- 24.<br/>- Yes.

0:47:04.217 --> 0:47:05.750
Nice.

0:47:10.828 --> 0:47:13.920
Press it all.

0:47:23.567 --> 0:47:25.770
No more bets.

0:47:31.046 --> 0:47:32.870
20.

0:47:32.945 --> 0:47:35.713
Holy fucking shit.

0:47:42.458 --> 0:47:44.893
Here.

0:47:44.958 --> 0:47:46.952
Much appreciated.

0:47:59.136 --> 0:48:01.873
<i>No more bets.</i>

0:48:15.788 --> 0:48:18.122
24 again.

0:48:28.506 --> 0:48:31.531
- He's dead.<br/>- What?

0:48:31.607 --> 0:48:33.603
What?

0:48:46.156 --> 0:48:47.251
What?

0:50:10.336 --> 0:50:12.200
I get it.

0:50:19.777 --> 0:50:23.081
I get it!
