00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:48,968
Whoa whoa<br/>whoa whoa!

3
00:01:51,371 --> 00:01:53,072
Stop dumping.<br/>Stop dumping.

4
00:01:53,206 --> 00:01:55,675
- What is matter?<br/>- Lower your bed.

5
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:58,411
You can't dump here no more.<br/>You need to talk to your boss.

6
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:00,279
Always we are<br/>dumping here.

7
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,215
Caballero, put the shit<br/>back in your truck.

8
00:02:02,281 --> 00:02:05,018
What?<br/>That is huge job!

9
00:02:12,158 --> 00:02:13,893
Where I am supposed<br/>to be dumping this now?

10
00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:33,246
I just now find out it's asbestos<br/>you've been dumping over there.

11
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:36,380
What did you<br/>think it was?

12
00:02:36,481 --> 00:02:38,158
I never asked.

13
00:02:38,214 --> 00:02:40,521
<i>Tampax-- What the<br/>fuck do I know?</i>

14
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:42,150
Well, now you know.

15
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:44,251
You and your friend there stefano<br/>have been pocketing how much

16
00:02:44,357 --> 00:02:47,420
On this cowboys-And-Indian<br/>asbestos removal?

17
00:02:47,565 --> 00:02:48,920
Billing the townships

18
00:02:49,027 --> 00:02:52,092
Like you're following<br/>althe epa regulations.

19
00:02:52,236 --> 00:02:54,563
You got the same scam, Phil, so why<br/>don't we cut through the bullshit?

20
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:56,701
<i>How much you figure<br/>you're owed on this?</i>

21
00:02:56,766 --> 00:02:59,000
- 25%.<br/>- Don't be an asshole.

22
00:02:59,108 --> 00:03:01,803
You know, there's close monitoring<br/>at every fucking landfill.

23
00:03:01,946 --> 00:03:04,113
Maybe if somebody had been<br/>upfront with me from the beginning.

24
00:03:04,176 --> 00:03:06,973
Nobody's been hiding nothing. I had the<br/>same dumping deal with what's-His-Name,

25
00:03:07,018 --> 00:03:10,612
The operation's manager since I've<br/>been there at barone sanitation.

26
00:03:10,756 --> 00:03:13,112
You're not there<br/>no more. I am.

27
00:03:13,186 --> 00:03:16,023
You're enjoying your<br/>generous severance package.

28
00:03:16,126 --> 00:03:19,190
25%-- That's not<br/>gonna happen.

29
00:03:19,358 --> 00:03:22,362
You've got a backyard,<br/>a pool, dump it there.

30
00:03:22,466 --> 00:03:24,863
That's my only<br/>other suggestion.

31
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,942
He's got us by the gazz'.<br/>I'll tell you that.

32
00:03:34,046 --> 00:03:36,600
Unless that guy at the pennsy<br/>landfill decides to play ball.

33
00:03:36,647 --> 00:03:39,771
That asshole's shitting his pants<br/>he'll get pinched by the epa.

34
00:03:39,876 --> 00:03:42,042
Frankly, Ton',

35
00:03:42,146 --> 00:03:43,880
I'm thinking maybe we<br/>should meet Phil's number.

36
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:47,783
Why? I think that would set a<br/>terrible precedent right now.

37
00:03:47,925 --> 00:03:49,722
Just bend over...

38
00:03:49,826 --> 00:03:51,951
when he just became boss<br/>of the family over there?

39
00:03:52,056 --> 00:03:54,791
Yeah, well,<br/>that's the flying ointment.

40
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:59,560
Even still,<br/>I say let him have it.

41
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,330
Life's too short.

42
00:04:01,406 --> 00:04:04,900
It's also too short to<br/>live it as a fucking lackey.

43
00:04:04,975 --> 00:04:07,071
True too.

44
00:04:09,748 --> 00:04:11,241
What is this,<br/>"make-Believe ballroom"?

45
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,980
How many times you gonna<br/>change the stations?

46
00:04:16,688 --> 00:04:18,752
This "departed" soundtrack's<br/>fucking killer.

47
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:20,750
<i>- You got it?<br/>- Yeah, it's good.</i>

48
00:04:23,995 --> 00:04:27,320
Regarding, Phil,<br/>I gotta ask:

49
00:04:27,426 --> 00:04:30,492
Whatever happened to<br/>"stop and smell the roses"?

50
00:04:32,498 --> 00:04:34,301
You're right.

51
00:04:34,365 --> 00:04:36,761
U're right.

52
00:04:36,937 --> 00:04:40,102
You can't fight every<br/>fucking battle, right?

53
00:04:41,605 --> 00:04:45,713
Asbestos...

54
00:04:56,286 --> 00:04:58,080
each day's a gift.

55
00:04:58,126 --> 00:05:00,722
Every time I look at my<br/>kid, that's what I realiz

56
00:05:00,866 --> 00:05:03,562
And that shit<br/>with Junior, please.

57
00:05:09,966 --> 00:05:13,302
Just that peoplike Phil,

58
00:05:13,476 --> 00:05:15,073
They're not<br/>on that page--

59
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,141
Take those rosesand stick 'em up<br/>your ass, thorns first.

60
00:05:23,645 --> 00:05:26,652
<i>- This system's<br/>got no balls.</i>

61
00:05:55,917 --> 00:05:58,783
So how was your party<br/>that day at the hous

62
00:06:01,087 --> 00:06:03,220
Slow the fuck down,<br/>will ya?!

63
00:06:27,216 --> 00:06:28,611
Maybe you sh<br/>go back, heidi.

64
00:06:28,715 --> 00:06:30,982
Kennedy, I'm on my<br/>learner's permit after dark.

65
00:06:40,596 --> 00:06:43,223
Ton'...

66
00:06:45,236 --> 00:06:48,232
you gotta...<br/>help me.

67
00:06:48,405 --> 00:06:50,731
I'm coming.

68
00:06:53,005 --> 00:06:54,940
I'll never pass<br/>the drug test.

69
00:06:55,008 --> 00:06:57,511
What?

70
00:06:57,618 --> 00:06:59,640
You gotta get me out.

71
00:06:59,776 --> 00:07:01,812
I'll lose my license.

72
00:07:51,735 --> 00:07:54,901
Never pass a drug test.

73
00:07:54,967 --> 00:07:56,632
Call me a taxi.

74
00:09:22,556 --> 00:09:24,293
<i>911.</i>

75
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,993
We've been<br/>in an accident.

76
00:09:26,127 --> 00:09:29,060
<i>Old pumping station road...</i>

77
00:09:29,228 --> 00:09:31,831
past the reservoir.

78
00:09:50,315 --> 00:09:51,851
Sorry about that.

79
00:09:51,956 --> 00:09:53,650
My friend...

80
00:09:53,786 --> 00:09:56,482
guy I came with,<br/>how is he?

81
00:09:56,626 --> 00:10:00,293
<i>Your friend is dead.<br/>Paramedics called it in the ambulance.</i>

82
00:10:00,428 --> 00:10:02,821
<i>Breathe in, please. Hold it.</i>

83
00:10:02,966 --> 00:10:05,590
Do you know a contact number<br/>for his next of kin?

84
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:10,971
His wife.

85
00:10:22,147 --> 00:10:25,611
<i>- Hello.<br/>- Hello, may I speak with Carmela Soprano?</i>

86
00:10:25,687 --> 00:10:28,053
<i>- Who is this?<br/>- Nurse al rosario,</i>

87
00:10:28,155 --> 00:10:31,491
<i>St. Clare's hospital, denville.<br/>Is mrs. Soprano there?</i>

88
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,493
Yes, this is<br/>mrs. Soprano.

89
00:10:33,626 --> 00:10:36,391
<i>I'm here with your husband.<br/>He'd like to speak with you.</i>

90
00:10:38,996 --> 00:10:42,501
<i>- Carm.<br/>- Tony, is everything okay?</i>

91
00:10:42,636 --> 00:10:44,033
<i>Are you sitting down?</i>

92
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:46,401
<i>- I'm serious.<br/>- Yes, I'm in bed.</i>

93
00:10:46,508 --> 00:10:48,243
<i>All right, listen.</i>

94
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:50,472
<i>Sweetheart,<br/>there's been an accident.</i>

95
00:10:51,977 --> 00:10:54,212
<i>We were coming back<br/>from the city and...</i>

96
00:10:55,517 --> 00:10:59,152
<i>- Christopher's dead.<br/>- Oh my God!</i>

97
00:10:59,215 --> 00:11:01,221
All right.

98
00:11:01,357 --> 00:11:03,652
- Carm.<br/>- What happened?

99
00:11:03,756 --> 00:11:07,362
He drove off the road<br/>and the car flipped over.

100
00:11:07,397 --> 00:11:09,991
<i>- I'll tell you in detail.<br/>- Are you okay?</i>

101
00:11:10,027 --> 00:11:11,992
I just banged my knee,<br/>the one from high school.

102
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,032
I'm fine, but...

103
00:11:15,535 --> 00:11:17,233
he wasn't wearing<br/>a belt.

104
00:11:17,338 --> 00:11:19,171
Where are you,<br/>St. Clare's?

105
00:11:19,236 --> 00:11:23,043
Listen, they're gonna call<br/>kelli if they haven't already...

106
00:11:24,248 --> 00:11:26,173
just get al and rita<br/>on the phone

107
00:11:26,247 --> 00:11:28,013
And get 'em started<br/>over there.

108
00:11:28,046 --> 00:11:31,880
All right, all right.<br/>Oh my God, Tony, he's dead?

109
00:11:31,956 --> 00:11:34,011
Yeah.

110
00:11:34,055 --> 00:11:37,422
All right.<br/>L-Let me get dressed.

111
00:11:43,196 --> 00:11:45,233
Thank you.

112
00:12:09,887 --> 00:12:13,723
Mr. Tony,<br/>Mr. Sil is here.

113
00:12:13,797 --> 00:12:15,521
Okay.

114
00:12:15,566 --> 00:12:18,733
- Mrs. Carmela say you should stay in bed.<br/>- Have him come up.

115
00:12:18,796 --> 00:12:20,503
We're right here, Ton'.

116
00:12:20,566 --> 00:12:22,563
We came as soon<br/>as we heard.

117
00:12:24,336 --> 00:12:27,570
- Ton'.<br/>- Patsy went over to Chrissy's mom's house.

118
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:30,141
- Yeah, that's where Carmela is.<br/>- Carlo's coming up.

119
00:12:30,245 --> 00:12:31,742
Yeah.

120
00:12:36,417 --> 00:12:38,983
- How you doing, Ton'?<br/>- My knee got banged up.

121
00:12:39,085 --> 00:12:41,081
<i>They said it's<br/>probably gonna be okay.</i>

122
00:12:42,607 --> 00:12:45,321
Last thing<br/>I remember was...

123
00:12:45,426 --> 00:12:47,362
we pulled away<br/>from Phil.

124
00:12:47,426 --> 00:12:49,922
Skid marks all over the<br/>place, the cops told Carm.

125
00:12:49,997 --> 00:12:52,992
He had a heavy foot,<br/>that kid, always.

126
00:12:53,098 --> 00:12:54,932
Almost put me through<br/>a billboard one time.

127
00:12:56,766 --> 00:12:59,002
- Hey, Ton'.<br/>- Come on in.

128
00:12:59,106 --> 00:13:01,400
I'm so sorry, Ton'.

129
00:13:01,475 --> 00:13:03,372
I still can't<br/>believe it.

130
00:13:03,508 --> 00:13:05,871
Thanks. I know<br/>you two were close.

131
00:13:05,946 --> 00:13:07,541
I was making<br/>my collections

132
00:13:07,716 --> 00:13:11,112
And Anthony maffei<br/>called me. Jesus.

133
00:13:15,887 --> 00:13:19,050
<i>It's carlo, I bet.</i>

134
00:13:19,157 --> 00:13:21,993
Fucking idiot didn't even<br/>have his seat belt on.

135
00:13:23,297 --> 00:13:26,063
His chest filled up.

136
00:13:27,237 --> 00:13:29,063
Suffocated<br/>on his own blood.

137
00:13:29,137 --> 00:13:31,971
- Oh, Jesus.<br/>- Jesus Christ.

138
00:13:32,076 --> 00:13:35,240
Seems like that's<br/>the cause of death.

139
00:13:37,148 --> 00:13:39,642
It's not carlo.<br/>I heard AJ.

140
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:41,712
Carlo's coming up?

141
00:13:41,816 --> 00:13:43,912
What's with you and carlfucking arrival?

142
00:13:44,017 --> 00:13:47,451
- I'm just saying.<br/>- They're gonna do a full blood test on him.

143
00:13:47,485 --> 00:13:50,052
See, you know,

144
00:13:50,155 --> 00:13:53,390
If alcohol,

145
00:13:53,421 --> 00:13:56,898
- Drugs or...<br/>- It did occur to me.

146
00:13:57,034 --> 00:13:59,391
He didn't seem high,<br/>did he?

147
00:13:59,499 --> 00:14:01,360
Are you kidding?<br/>I would have been furi

148
00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:03,430
I would have fucking<br/>strangled him.

149
00:14:03,505 --> 00:14:05,901
He'd been working the program<br/>ever since he threw little Paulie

150
00:14:06,006 --> 00:14:08,841
- Out that window.<br/>- Let's not go there.

151
00:14:08,907 --> 00:14:11,212
Even before that<br/>he was battling that shit.

152
00:14:11,347 --> 00:14:13,172
He gave it his all.

153
00:14:13,348 --> 00:14:16,610
Well, anyway,<br/>he's gone now,

154
00:14:16,686 --> 00:14:18,682
Our Chrissy.

155
00:14:20,086 --> 00:14:21,683
Crazy fucking maniac.

156
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:25,850
The thing to take<br/>to heart, t,

157
00:14:26,027 --> 00:14:27,993
You're here.<br/>You're all right.

158
00:14:28,027 --> 00:14:30,021
You could have been killed,<br/>for ck's sake.

159
00:14:30,197 --> 00:14:32,432
What are you gonna do?

160
00:14:35,867 --> 00:14:37,303
Thanks.

161
00:14:37,378 --> 00:14:39,701
Whoa.<br/>What are you doing?

162
00:14:39,806 --> 00:14:42,202
No no no, I gotta<br/>try and get up.

163
00:14:42,278 --> 00:14:45,743
Gotta go and meet Carm<br/>over at Chrissy's.

164
00:14:45,816 --> 00:14:47,883
Kelli and all that.

165
00:14:49,615 --> 00:14:51,380
I'll make you<br/>a plate.

166
00:14:51,456 --> 00:14:53,980
- Get me a scotch.<br/>- Are you serious?

167
00:14:54,057 --> 00:14:56,821
Yeah, and have<br/>one yourself.

168
00:15:00,565 --> 00:15:03,793
They were close,<br/>two cousins.

169
00:15:08,765 --> 00:15:10,573
You all right?

170
00:15:11,907 --> 00:15:14,671
I know I had my<br/>differences with that kid,

171
00:15:14,745 --> 00:15:18,170
But maybe I didn't<br/>do right by him, neither.

172
00:15:18,248 --> 00:15:20,680
If you were his dad,<br/>I was his dutch uncle,

173
00:15:20,748 --> 00:15:24,111
And what the fuck did<br/>I do but get pissed off,

174
00:15:24,188 --> 00:15:27,920
Fight with him over<br/>cocksucking fucking money?

175
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:30,922
I'd break his balls when<br/>he ied not to have a drink

176
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:33,020
Or a little taste<br/>of snow.

177
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:35,763
It's over, Paulie.

178
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,673
Did anybody ever hear<br/>from the hospital?

179
00:15:43,778 --> 00:15:46,002
I was waiting<br/>till kelli woke up.

180
00:15:47,478 --> 00:15:50,372
They found cocaine<br/>in his blood.

181
00:15:50,445 --> 00:15:53,512
- Madonn'.<br/>- 'Cause of death was a hemothorax.

182
00:15:53,547 --> 00:15:56,612
Yeah, airbags can crush the ribs<br/>when there's no other restraint.

183
00:15:56,785 --> 00:15:59,611
They said he might<br/>have made it,

184
00:15:59,785 --> 00:16:00,950
But he didn't.

185
00:16:01,058 --> 00:16:02,850
Couldn't have worn<br/>his goddamn seat belt?

186
00:16:02,957 --> 00:16:05,323
- No wonder. He was<br/>whack-A-Doo. - Al, just stop it.

187
00:16:05,357 --> 00:16:08,391
Aw, baloney. He leaves<br/>our granddaughter fatherless.

188
00:16:09,798 --> 00:16:11,963
My only child!

189
00:16:12,066 --> 00:16:14,300
Drinking won't help,<br/>honey.

190
00:16:14,368 --> 00:16:16,303
Jesus Christ.

191
00:16:20,308 --> 00:16:22,873
Look at this.<br/>Syracuse is losing.

192
00:16:27,888 --> 00:16:29,783
I don't know<br/>what to say.

193
00:16:29,886 --> 00:16:32,310
- What?<br/>- I just got a call from little Paulie.

194
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:35,152
Nucci gualtieri died.

195
00:16:37,025 --> 00:16:39,622
Stroke on the bus back<br/>to the home.

196
00:16:39,697 --> 00:16:42,192
They had gone<br/>to see "Jersey boys."

197
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:47,600
This is difficult.

198
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:50,501
This is pain

199
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,371
Like I'm not used to.

200
00:16:52,405 --> 00:16:55,771
We've said before he was<br/>like a son in some ways.

201
00:16:55,877 --> 00:16:58,041
To see him die<br/>like that...

202
00:16:59,048 --> 00:17:00,712
practically<br/>in my arms.

203
00:17:00,785 --> 00:17:04,351
He was just starting<br/>his life.

204
00:17:04,516 --> 00:17:07,353
Yeah.

205
00:17:15,396 --> 00:17:17,133
You know what?

206
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:21,300
- This is bullshit.<br/>- What?

207
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:24,033
I haven't been able<br/>to tell anybody this, but...

208
00:17:25,806 --> 00:17:27,942
I'm fucking relieved.

209
00:17:28,045 --> 00:17:29,871
Really?

210
00:17:29,977 --> 00:17:31,972
He was a tremendous drag<br/>on my emotions,

211
00:17:32,046 --> 00:17:35,583
On my... thoughts<br/>about the future.

212
00:17:36,887 --> 00:17:38,850
Every morning<br/>I wake up thinking,

213
00:17:38,886 --> 00:17:41,050
"Is today the day that<br/>one of my best friends

214
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,221
Is gonna dime me<br/>to the FBI?"

215
00:17:43,428 --> 00:17:45,623
And a weak,<br/>fucking sniveling,

216
00:17:45,657 --> 00:17:48,162
Lying drug addict? That's<br/>the worst kind of bet.

217
00:17:48,225 --> 00:17:51,230
The biggest blunder<br/>of my career

218
00:17:51,297 --> 00:17:53,531
Is now gone.

219
00:17:53,567 --> 00:17:57,072
And I don't have to be<br/>confronted by that fact no more.

220
00:17:58,237 --> 00:18:00,371
And as a relative,<br/>a friend,

221
00:18:00,406 --> 00:18:03,403
Someone you can<br/>count on...

222
00:18:04,915 --> 00:18:06,770
I see.

223
00:18:11,617 --> 00:18:13,550
Let me tell you<br/>something:

224
00:18:13,658 --> 00:18:16,882
I've murdered friends<br/>before, even relatives--

225
00:18:17,028 --> 00:18:19,352
My cousin Tony,

226
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,923
My best friend--<br/>Puss.

227
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:27,462
But this...

228
00:18:32,036 --> 00:18:34,443
was I talking<br/>in my sleep?

229
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,803
Snoring.

230
00:18:36,878 --> 00:18:38,611
I'm gonna put on the TV<br/>if you don't mind.

231
00:18:38,677 --> 00:18:41,480
I can't stay asleep<br/>either. I'm all...

232
00:18:47,486 --> 00:18:50,391
I mean, I can laugh and cry,<br/>and I could always get the part.

233
00:18:50,498 --> 00:18:53,222
- First time?<br/>- First time. Never can keep it.

234
00:18:53,358 --> 00:18:55,490
They got onto me<br/>after a while.

235
00:18:55,627 --> 00:18:58,263
I'd lose my voice, fall<br/>down, get red in the face,

236
00:18:58,365 --> 00:19:01,001
Talk too fast<br/>and couldn't act.

237
00:19:31,265 --> 00:19:33,732
Can you make me<br/>a cappuccino?

238
00:19:33,836 --> 00:19:36,830
That fucking machine from Paulie,<br/>you need a pilot's license.

239
00:19:40,606 --> 00:19:43,573
It's so hard not to think of<br/>Christopher as a child, isn't it?

240
00:19:43,617 --> 00:19:47,041
Caity kind of looks likeim,<br/>which makes it doubly hard

241
00:19:48,618 --> 00:19:50,911
Of course that's not<br/>gonna do her any favors

242
00:19:51,018 --> 00:19:53,552
When she hits puberty--<br/>That schnoz.

243
00:19:53,618 --> 00:19:56,182
A lot of women<br/>found him very attractive.

244
00:19:58,556 --> 00:20:01,293
I think to myself,

245
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:05,190
How could I have ever said<br/>those things about him,

246
00:20:05,308 --> 00:20:09,030
About him and adriana, what<br/>her mother said he did to her?

247
00:20:15,106 --> 00:20:17,410
Obviously he was violent as an adult.

248
00:20:17,478 --> 00:20:21,143
His upbringing,<br/>but he adored Ade.

249
00:20:21,285 --> 00:20:23,750
He could never let<br/>himself take her life.

250
00:20:25,715 --> 00:20:27,382
Why are we<br/>so quick to blame?

251
00:20:27,485 --> 00:20:29,123
What is<br/>the attraction in that?

252
00:20:43,065 --> 00:20:45,073
It's good.

253
00:20:45,108 --> 00:20:47,071
Thank you.

254
00:20:49,145 --> 00:20:52,240
When I called you...

255
00:20:52,315 --> 00:20:53,943
the night after<br/>the accident,

256
00:20:54,085 --> 00:20:55,813
And you asked me,

257
00:20:55,915 --> 00:20:58,652
"Oh my God, Tony,<br/>he's dead?"

258
00:20:58,755 --> 00:21:00,851
Yeah.

259
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,150
And I thought--

260
00:21:03,255 --> 00:21:06,152
Well, I thought<br/>I picked up a twinge of...

261
00:21:09,665 --> 00:21:11,590
- relief.<br/>- What?

262
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:13,261
It just seemed like--<br/>I don't know--

263
00:21:13,336 --> 00:21:15,662
How could you say that? You don't<br/>know what you're talking about.

264
00:21:15,805 --> 00:21:17,103
Okay, good, I'm wrong.

265
00:21:17,206 --> 00:21:19,102
Maybe if you did pick up<br/>something like that,

266
00:21:19,207 --> 00:21:21,341
Maybe it's because<br/>I warelieved...

267
00:21:21,478 --> 00:21:23,373
that it was him<br/>and not you.

268
00:21:23,477 --> 00:21:26,371
Well, don't feel bad about<br/>that. That makes sense.

269
00:21:29,386 --> 00:21:32,151
To be going down<br/>to the hospital again

270
00:21:32,216 --> 00:21:34,222
At 2:00 in the morning?

271
00:21:39,395 --> 00:21:41,623
And you know what?<br/>When you were shot,

272
00:21:41,696 --> 00:21:43,962
It was Christopher<br/>who held me.

273
00:21:48,806 --> 00:21:51,701
You know<br/>the baby's car seat?

274
00:21:53,205 --> 00:21:55,871
A giant tree branch<br/>came through the window

275
00:21:55,906 --> 00:21:57,911
And demolished it.

276
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:03,310
She would have<br/>been dead, caitlin,

277
00:22:03,418 --> 00:22:05,481
Mangled beyond<br/>recognition.

278
00:22:18,395 --> 00:22:20,292
I told her about<br/>the baby seat

279
00:22:20,407 --> 00:22:22,331
So she wouldn't<br/>feel so rotten.

280
00:22:22,406 --> 00:22:25,031
I mean, he was high as a fucking<br/>kite. I didn't tell her that.

281
00:22:25,076 --> 00:22:28,600
In retrospect,<br/>maybe not the best approach.

282
00:22:28,676 --> 00:22:32,410
Right,<br/>I'm the asshole... again.

283
00:22:34,048 --> 00:22:36,443
What?

284
00:22:38,187 --> 00:22:40,011
No, go ahead.

285
00:22:41,586 --> 00:22:44,693
It's amazing<br/>how things work.

286
00:22:44,795 --> 00:22:48,260
His mother,<br/>cousin joanne,

287
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:50,023
A lush.

288
00:22:50,128 --> 00:22:52,962
Totally abandoned him<br/>as a parent,

289
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,763
But now she's reaping<br/>all the sympathy

290
00:22:55,866 --> 00:22:57,973
And the tears.

291
00:22:58,138 --> 00:23:00,701
How are you doing,<br/>Anthony?

292
00:23:02,546 --> 00:23:05,211
There have been<br/>some hard moments.

293
00:23:07,215 --> 00:23:09,543
But a weak,<br/>lying drug at

294
00:23:09,648 --> 00:23:11,612
Who fantasized<br/>about my downfall,

295
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:14,052
Who even showed people<br/>his filthy thoughts

296
00:23:14,157 --> 00:23:16,151
On a movie screen...?

297
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:21,120
Let me tell you something:<br/>I've seen friends die before,

298
00:23:21,225 --> 00:23:23,793
Accidents,

299
00:23:23,896 --> 00:23:25,962
Even murder.

300
00:23:26,065 --> 00:23:28,063
My cousin Tony,<br/>they shot his face away.

301
00:23:28,165 --> 00:23:31,501
And I was fucking<br/>prostate with grief.

302
00:23:31,606 --> 00:23:33,133
But this?

303
00:23:34,348 --> 00:23:36,340
I see.

304
00:23:36,447 --> 00:23:38,642
And it occurs to me,<br/>I hand-Carried this kid

305
00:23:38,678 --> 00:23:41,180
Through the worst<br/>crisis he ever had.

306
00:23:43,185 --> 00:23:46,450
I can't go<br/>into particulars, but...

307
00:23:46,616 --> 00:23:48,781
wives, girlfriends,

308
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:50,691
They can complicate life<br/>in a major way.

309
00:23:50,855 --> 00:23:52,992
I don't have to<br/>tell you that.

310
00:23:56,326 --> 00:23:59,293
Anyway, huge problem<br/>of his own making.

311
00:24:01,508 --> 00:24:04,302
And he cried.<br/>He couldn't deal with it.

312
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:06,102
So...

313
00:24:06,138 --> 00:24:08,970
I took up the slack.<br/>I handled it.

314
00:24:09,106 --> 00:24:11,043
I felt sorry<br/>for him.

315
00:24:12,478 --> 00:24:14,341
Now he talked gratitude...

316
00:24:16,046 --> 00:24:17,680
but guess what py<br/>produces in the recipient.

317
00:24:17,787 --> 00:24:19,883
<i>They shit<br/>on your pity.</i>

318
00:24:21,558 --> 00:24:24,522
That's what broke<br/>the camel's back.

319
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:28,291
How are you<br/>handling all this?

320
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:30,792
The worst part,<br/>truthfully,

321
00:24:30,895 --> 00:24:33,063
Is I gotta sit there

322
00:24:33,168 --> 00:24:36,630
Withple<br/>who are hurting... bad.

323
00:24:37,838 --> 00:24:41,002
And I gotta have<br/>the long face

324
00:24:41,076 --> 00:24:44,010
And the sighing<br/>and the platitudes.

325
00:24:45,576 --> 00:24:47,540
But I don't feel it.

326
00:24:50,248 --> 00:24:52,510
Then that makes me feel<br/>like a hypocrite.

327
00:24:54,686 --> 00:24:57,052
And that makes<br/>me mad at them.

328
00:25:20,047 --> 00:25:22,281
Oh, hi.

329
00:25:22,348 --> 00:25:24,951
How are you?

330
00:25:30,027 --> 00:25:31,422
Julianna skiffle,

331
00:25:31,525 --> 00:25:34,263
This is my wife<br/>Carmela Soprano.

332
00:25:34,397 --> 00:25:35,721
Skiff.

333
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:37,933
Oh, yeah, right.

334
00:25:38,065 --> 00:25:41,732
Julianna's a real estate<br/>agent in the old neighborhood.

335
00:25:41,805 --> 00:25:43,703
And you knew<br/>Christopher?

336
00:25:43,807 --> 00:25:45,473
I used to buy my meat<br/>at Satriale's.

337
00:25:49,106 --> 00:25:52,443
I'm a recovering addict.

338
00:25:53,715 --> 00:25:56,441
- I owe him a lot.<br/>- That's nice to hear.

339
00:25:58,917 --> 00:26:02,053
- Well, what are you gonna do, huh?<br/>- Nothing you can do.

340
00:26:02,088 --> 00:26:04,550
That's my point.

341
00:26:04,626 --> 00:26:06,253
He was too young.

342
00:26:08,827 --> 00:26:10,890
Good-Looking woman.

343
00:26:30,987 --> 00:26:33,252
They did<br/>a beautiful job on him.

344
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:42,591
Oh, I'm gonna go up.

345
00:26:43,865 --> 00:26:46,662
I'll go up later,

346
00:26:46,766 --> 00:26:49,663
Give my seat to someone<br/>in the meantime.

347
00:26:54,478 --> 00:26:56,472
How are you doing?

348
00:26:59,178 --> 00:27:02,210
- It's tough.<br/>- Yeah.

349
00:27:02,317 --> 00:27:04,481
He loved y so much.

350
00:27:05,786 --> 00:27:08,380
- Yeah?<br/>- Well, you know he did.

351
00:27:14,328 --> 00:27:16,393
I'll go up later.

352
00:27:33,216 --> 00:27:36,482
There she is.<br/>3 to 5, 7 to 9.

353
00:27:36,587 --> 00:27:38,153
<i>Why do they call her that?</i>

354
00:27:38,215 --> 00:27:39,752
She never<br/>misses a wake.

355
00:27:45,095 --> 00:27:46,491
Oh, lord, oh, lord!

356
00:27:46,557 --> 00:27:48,561
Fucking<br/>James brown now.

357
00:27:51,738 --> 00:27:53,930
I'm serious.<br/>I can't take it.

358
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:57,501
It's all right.<br/>We're here for you.

359
00:27:57,575 --> 00:28:00,100
Oh my God.<br/>Look at this.

360
00:28:04,347 --> 00:28:07,512
- Like a movie star.<br/>- Jackie kennedy.

361
00:28:25,768 --> 00:28:28,300
- I'm sorry for the loss of your cousin, bro.<br/>- Thanks.

362
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:31,470
Me too, bro, me too.

363
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:33,701
He was a good guy.

364
00:28:33,775 --> 00:28:37,112
Hey, don't let<br/>this linger

365
00:28:37,245 --> 00:28:38,513
On your head now.

366
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:39,811
You know what<br/>I'm talking about.

367
00:28:51,656 --> 00:28:53,323
You know that night,

368
00:28:53,425 --> 00:28:55,593
A tree limb came in<br/>through the car window,

369
00:28:55,666 --> 00:28:59,062
Completely destroyed<br/>the baby seat.

370
00:28:59,138 --> 00:29:01,300
Tony.

371
00:29:01,437 --> 00:29:04,303
You guys are gonna<br/>hang in a while, right?

372
00:29:04,435 --> 00:29:07,073
We really should make an<br/>appearance at the other wake.

373
00:29:26,496 --> 00:29:28,792
Are we that late?

374
00:29:28,865 --> 00:29:30,662
Glad you came.

375
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:32,930
- He'll appreciate it.<br/>- Oh, please.

376
00:29:48,988 --> 00:29:50,810
I gotta<br/>get out of here.

377
00:29:54,985 --> 00:29:56,953
- Paul.<br/>- Ton'.

378
00:29:57,998 --> 00:29:59,993
Thanks for coming.

379
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:03,732
We are so sorry<br/>for your loss, Paulie.

380
00:30:03,795 --> 00:30:05,860
How you hangin' in,<br/>paolucc'?

381
00:30:05,995 --> 00:30:07,402
As well as can be expected.

382
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:09,161
Must be very<br/>hard for you.

383
00:30:09,236 --> 00:30:11,172
I know how close the two<br/>of you had become again

384
00:30:11,235 --> 00:30:12,671
Yeah.

385
00:30:12,807 --> 00:30:14,473
Not much<br/>of a sendoff here.

386
00:30:14,508 --> 00:30:17,810
- The room is beautiful, Paulie.<br/>- Nobody's in it.

387
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:19,573
What kind<br/>of testament is this

388
00:30:19,677 --> 00:30:21,340
To the spirit and<br/>generosity of the woman?

389
00:30:21,415 --> 00:30:23,083
We're here<br/>for you, Paulie.

390
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:24,811
You know that.

391
00:30:24,885 --> 00:30:26,350
Okay.

392
00:30:31,328 --> 00:30:33,321
It's a fundamental<br/>lack of respect

393
00:30:33,355 --> 00:30:35,223
And I'm never gonna<br/>fuckin' forget it, neither.

394
00:30:35,365 --> 00:30:38,263
Jesus, Paulie, people your<br/>mother's age, their friends die off.

395
00:30:38,368 --> 00:30:40,163
What, she outlived<br/>sil? Carlo?

396
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:41,862
They're all over there<br/>at your nephew's.

397
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:44,533
- Yeah, but-- - Councilman<br/>carillo was here three minutes.

398
00:30:44,607 --> 00:30:46,173
I clocked him.

399
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:51,372
People are comin'<br/>and they don't, fuck 'em.

400
00:30:51,415 --> 00:30:53,740
I got 500 prayer cards.

401
00:30:53,888 --> 00:30:55,113
Well, Carm and I aere.

402
00:30:55,188 --> 00:30:56,340
What the fuck<br/>is that? Nothin'?

403
00:30:57,617 --> 00:30:59,181
No, Ton', of course not.

404
00:30:59,255 --> 00:31:01,883
- Means the world.<br/>- Okay.

405
00:31:03,588 --> 00:31:05,350
She suffered too,<br/>you know.

406
00:31:05,428 --> 00:31:08,063
Yeah, well, this isn't<br/>the time or the place.

407
00:31:08,196 --> 00:31:09,963
You're right.

408
00:31:13,366 --> 00:31:15,031
How have you been<br/>dealing witht?

409
00:31:15,066 --> 00:31:17,973
It's really sad but it's<br/>kinda the same as with blanca.

410
00:31:18,038 --> 00:31:21,172
I mean, I don't really just keep<br/>thinking about things the way I did--

411
00:31:21,205 --> 00:31:23,342
Over and over,<br/>you know?

412
00:31:23,377 --> 00:31:26,372
Well, for one thing,<br/>perhaps the meds are working.

413
00:31:27,987 --> 00:31:29,643
Did you finally enroll?

414
00:31:29,785 --> 00:31:31,713
I'm in a few classes

415
00:31:31,887 --> 00:31:34,220
Unofficially, until my<br/>transcript clears from ramapo.

416
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:36,322
Beginning english.

417
00:31:36,388 --> 00:31:38,893
Oh, and I went<br/>to a class on the history

418
00:31:39,055 --> 00:31:40,793
Of the israeli-Palestinian<br/>conflict.

419
00:31:40,926 --> 00:31:44,062
- Wow.<br/>- I mean, it's hard to pick up in the middle.

420
00:31:44,166 --> 00:31:46,333
I might take it<br/>xt semester.

421
00:31:46,397 --> 00:31:48,661
I mean, it's so<br/>dicked-Up over there

422
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:51,103
And no one knows<br/>who started it.

423
00:31:51,178 --> 00:31:52,803
- Are you sleeping?<br/>- What? In class?

424
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:56,100
No. You were having<br/>trouble, remember?

425
00:31:58,075 --> 00:32:00,442
Wellbutrin xl<br/>kicks ass.

426
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:02,940
I'm hearing good things<br/>about the lexapro.

427
00:32:02,986 --> 00:32:05,083
Check it, paisan.<br/>Long John shithead.

428
00:32:08,055 --> 00:32:10,181
That kid's in my<br/>south American lit class.

429
00:32:10,288 --> 00:32:12,351
He had his toes amputated.

430
00:32:17,298 --> 00:32:19,131
He said it was an accident<br/>with his car battery.

431
00:32:19,165 --> 00:32:20,800
Acid burned right<br/>through his shoe.

432
00:32:36,718 --> 00:32:39,353
Oh, you litt<br/>shfooyadell.

433
00:32:39,488 --> 00:32:41,123
She should nurse.

434
00:32:42,155 --> 00:32:43,890
At least somebody<br/>feels like eating.

435
00:32:45,355 --> 00:32:47,660
She doesn't know.

436
00:32:47,725 --> 00:32:49,761
Isn't God wonderful<br/>that way?

437
00:32:59,907 --> 00:33:02,970
<i>- Hello?<br/>- Alan, it's Tony. You busy?</i>

438
00:33:03,076 --> 00:33:04,713
Usual shit--<br/>Some Japanese guy

439
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:07,142
Got his suit ruined<br/>at cirque du soleil.

440
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:09,983
<i>- Listen, I need a suite.<br/>- So all the guys coming out?</i>

441
00:33:10,085 --> 00:33:11,880
No no. I'm solo.

442
00:33:11,986 --> 00:33:14,853
Oh. We'll see what<br/>we can do about that.

443
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:18,093
<i>Look, I just want to-<br/>Peace and quiet...</i>

444
00:33:18,228 --> 00:33:20,720
- ...chill out.<br/>- You set for transpo?

445
00:33:20,826 --> 00:33:23,192
<i>I'll be happy<br/>to send a plane.</i>

446
00:33:58,367 --> 00:33:59,592
No more bets.

447
00:34:02,035 --> 00:34:05,033
33 black odd.

448
00:34:15,217 --> 00:34:16,411
No more bets.

449
00:34:18,918 --> 00:34:21,921
Five red odd.

450
00:34:56,086 --> 00:34:58,153
It's hard to imagine<br/>for a poet,

451
00:34:58,258 --> 00:35:01,692
But wordsworth<br/>was as rich and popular

452
00:35:01,797 --> 00:35:03,460
As, say, someone like

453
00:35:03,596 --> 00:35:05,963
<i>John grisham nowadays.</i>

454
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:08,101
But wordsworth writes

455
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:10,830
"The world is<br/>too much with us."

456
00:35:10,937 --> 00:35:13,202
Later, he invokes<br/>nature again.

457
00:35:14,847 --> 00:35:18,342
Why such strong words<br/>against the material world?

458
00:36:02,585 --> 00:36:05,422
That was fast.

459
00:36:05,525 --> 00:36:07,261
The gatehouse<br/>usually gives

460
00:36:07,396 --> 00:36:09,391
Shitty directions to<br/>the east tower. Come in.

461
00:36:11,767 --> 00:36:13,702
<i>So...</i>

462
00:36:14,935 --> 00:36:18,000
you're a friend<br/>of Chris.

463
00:36:18,076 --> 00:36:20,373
Yeah...<br/>Tony, by the way.

464
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:22,241
No, I know.

465
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,872
He's mentioned you,<br/>actually.

466
00:36:23,946 --> 00:36:26,572
Well, I heard nothing<br/>but nice things about you.

467
00:36:27,948 --> 00:36:31,513
Except... you're more<br/>beautiful than he let on.

468
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:33,680
<i>- Really?<br/>- Talked about ya...</i>

469
00:36:33,756 --> 00:36:36,682
a few times, told me more<br/>than once to look you up.

470
00:36:36,757 --> 00:36:38,092
Did he?

471
00:36:39,527 --> 00:36:41,292
Well well well.

472
00:36:44,538 --> 00:36:46,131
You want a drink<br/>or something?

473
00:36:46,267 --> 00:36:48,961
I got some pinot grigio<br/>in the fridge.

474
00:36:54,806 --> 00:36:57,440
I got some, uh...

475
00:36:57,546 --> 00:36:59,640
serious news.

476
00:36:59,716 --> 00:37:02,043
- Uh-Oh.<br/>- It's about Christopher.

477
00:37:03,546 --> 00:37:05,712
- He's dead.<br/>- At?

478
00:37:06,887 --> 00:37:08,550
It was a car accident,

479
00:37:08,658 --> 00:37:10,823
Happened<br/>a couple days ago.

480
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:15,891
Oh my God.

481
00:37:16,898 --> 00:37:19,060
That's fucking awful.

482
00:37:19,236 --> 00:37:21,031
I'm sorry.

483
00:37:21,068 --> 00:37:24,431
- What happened?<br/>- Bad wreck...

484
00:37:24,507 --> 00:37:26,631
high-Speed...

485
00:37:28,178 --> 00:37:29,800
he was killed instantly.

486
00:37:29,907 --> 00:37:31,811
Somehow, I walked away.

487
00:37:31,918 --> 00:37:33,942
Jesus, that must<br/>have been scary.

488
00:37:34,017 --> 00:37:37,250
The fuckin' sound alone...

489
00:37:37,316 --> 00:37:39,912
did he ever...

490
00:37:40,088 --> 00:37:42,583
marry that one girl--The one wh-

491
00:37:42,655 --> 00:37:44,350
No.

492
00:37:45,426 --> 00:37:47,262
Found a real sweetheart,<br/>though-- Kelli--

493
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:49,260
And...

494
00:37:49,365 --> 00:37:51,030
they just had<br/>a baby girl.

495
00:37:51,097 --> 00:37:53,090
Maybe that's good,<br/>you know?

496
00:37:54,507 --> 00:37:57,771
I mean,<br/>bad that he left her,

497
00:37:57,878 --> 00:38:00,671
But good that he--<br/>He left something.

498
00:38:06,447 --> 00:38:08,611
I thought<br/>you should know.

499
00:38:13,685 --> 00:38:15,622
Well, um...

500
00:38:18,798 --> 00:38:21,290
extremely cool, you coming<br/>over here. I appreciate that.

501
00:38:23,396 --> 00:38:25,731
- How long you here for?<br/>- I don't know.

502
00:38:25,797 --> 00:38:28,800
Just play it as I go.

503
00:38:49,156 --> 00:38:51,322
<i>- What's up?<br/>- It's stefano.</i>

504
00:38:51,397 --> 00:38:54,262
Look, I'm sorry to bother you,<br/>but I'm here at the school.

505
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:56,092
<i>The asbestos,<br/>it's backing up.</i>

506
00:38:56,166 --> 00:38:57,990
<i>I've gotta dump<br/>this shit.</i>

507
00:38:58,165 --> 00:39:00,262
<i>It's not wrapped to code and<br/>all the other violations--</i>

508
00:39:00,337 --> 00:39:03,161
- Yeah?<br/>- I could get nailed big time.

509
00:39:03,237 --> 00:39:05,201
We're workin' on it, John.

510
00:39:05,336 --> 00:39:06,771
I'm trying<br/>to negotiate it out,

511
00:39:06,835 --> 00:39:08,442
But the asshole's<br/>taking a hard line for now.

512
00:39:08,477 --> 00:39:11,011
Just hang in there,<br/>let me do my thing.

513
00:39:11,116 --> 00:39:12,941
All right.

514
00:39:18,755 --> 00:39:20,351
- Whoa.<br/>- Jeff'll clean it up.

515
00:39:20,428 --> 00:39:22,223
Make him clean it<br/>in his bare feet.

516
00:39:22,286 --> 00:39:25,353
I got the venison steaks!

517
00:39:25,525 --> 00:39:29,422
Oh!

518
00:39:29,565 --> 00:39:31,593
Oh!

519
00:39:32,766 --> 00:39:35,202
What the fuck?<br/>You blind?

520
00:39:35,367 --> 00:39:38,003
Me?! You open the door,<br/>you don't look at all.

521
00:39:38,108 --> 00:39:40,072
Aw, shit, you wrecked<br/>my fuckin' door.

522
00:39:40,135 --> 00:39:42,370
- You did that to your own door!<br/>- Whoa whoa whoa.

523
00:39:42,476 --> 00:39:44,042
What the fuck<br/>did you say?

524
00:39:44,118 --> 00:39:46,311
I said he opened the door,<br/>he don't look at all.

525
00:39:46,415 --> 00:39:48,082
Look at my fuckin' bike!

526
00:39:48,147 --> 00:39:50,011
- Do you hear this guy?<br/>- You saw it!

527
00:39:50,118 --> 00:39:52,651
Fuck you, nigger.

528
00:39:54,657 --> 00:39:56,150
I am not a nigger!

529
00:39:56,286 --> 00:39:58,651
I am from somalia!<br/>I go to school and I work!

530
00:39:58,756 --> 00:40:00,220
Do not call me<br/>a nigger!

531
00:40:00,326 --> 00:40:02,323
So you're some<br/>terrorist piece of shit.

532
00:40:02,395 --> 00:40:05,061
Either way, motherfucker,<br/>you're in the wrong neighborhood.

533
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:06,892
Get the fuck away!

534
00:40:08,666 --> 00:40:10,500
You a tough nigger now?!

535
00:40:10,578 --> 00:40:12,502
You got something to say?

536
00:40:14,307 --> 00:40:16,741
<i>Cocksucker!</i>

537
00:40:57,215 --> 00:41:00,252
Do you mind?

538
00:41:00,315 --> 00:41:03,380
No, knock yourself out.

539
00:41:06,626 --> 00:41:09,393
This is the--

540
00:41:09,496 --> 00:41:12,030
This is the new shit--

541
00:41:12,138 --> 00:41:14,660
Medical-Grade, mellow,

542
00:41:14,737 --> 00:41:16,731
Paranoia-Free.

543
00:41:19,005 --> 00:41:21,703
Oh, well, that's good.

544
00:41:28,216 --> 00:41:31,482
Oh, Chris loved<br/>to party.

545
00:41:31,586 --> 00:41:33,983
What's your point?

546
00:41:34,056 --> 00:41:36,980
Nothing.<br/>You just...

547
00:41:37,057 --> 00:41:39,822
remind me<br/>of him, obviously.

548
00:41:41,825 --> 00:41:44,161
What's that mean?<br/>I fuck like him?

549
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:50,001
So much<br/>for paranoia-Free.

550
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:52,600
No, you were his<br/>friend, that's all.

551
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:55,173
Why would you<br/>bring him up?

552
00:41:55,245 --> 00:41:58,010
All I'm saying

553
00:41:58,076 --> 00:41:59,613
Is that there's<br/>a certain kind of guy

554
00:41:59,677 --> 00:42:01,942
That I don't run into<br/>on campus.

555
00:42:02,016 --> 00:42:04,413
But where I dance--

556
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:07,183
That accent,<br/>the clothes.

557
00:42:07,286 --> 00:42:08,852
I'm a type?

558
00:42:09,028 --> 00:42:11,693
This coming from the girl who's<br/>stripping her way through college?

559
00:42:11,798 --> 00:42:14,523
Actually,<br/>you're a surprise.

560
00:42:14,626 --> 00:42:16,691
Chris sometimes talked<br/>about some sad shit,

561
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:19,033
But you seem--<br/>I don't know--

562
00:42:20,737 --> 00:42:22,132
Actually sad.

563
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:25,132
Not right now I'm not.

564
00:42:25,206 --> 00:42:27,873
Jesus, this is some<br/>pretty fucking amazing dope.

565
00:42:29,807 --> 00:42:32,612
Chris said you two...

566
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,410
took peyote together.

567
00:42:34,487 --> 00:42:36,481
Yeah.

568
00:42:36,586 --> 00:42:40,153
I mean, I haven't done<br/>buttons in a while, though.

569
00:42:45,427 --> 00:42:47,920
You know, I've been thinking<br/>why the fuck I'm here.

570
00:42:47,995 --> 00:42:49,823
You can get<br/>to that place.

571
00:42:49,966 --> 00:42:52,932
No. No, I mean Vegas.

572
00:42:52,997 --> 00:42:56,001
<i>Truth is I always wanted<br/>to try that shit...</i>

573
00:42:57,635 --> 00:42:59,802
but I always had

574
00:42:59,937 --> 00:43:02,803
All the responsibilities.

575
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:09,910
You're a hard man<br/>to reach.

576
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:11,851
Nobody's seen hide<br/>nor hair.

577
00:43:11,918 --> 00:43:13,782
Yeah, I'm away.<br/>What do you want?

578
00:43:13,886 --> 00:43:15,723
<i>What do I want?<br/>I'm returning your call.</i>

579
00:43:15,827 --> 00:43:17,552
I think this got nothing<br/>to do with asbestos.

580
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:20,290
Why don't you let go of the<br/>old shit and be a businessman?

581
00:43:20,367 --> 00:43:22,961
- You got everything you want.<br/>- Not everything.

582
00:43:23,025 --> 00:43:26,593
But listen, allow me<br/>to express my condolences

583
00:43:26,766 --> 00:43:28,600
Regarding your nephew.

584
00:43:28,708 --> 00:43:30,161
This is me hanging up.

585
00:43:39,818 --> 00:43:42,482
- I can tell you're upset.<br/>- Big fucking deal.

586
00:43:42,548 --> 00:43:46,512
- What exactly happened this week?<br/>- Nothing.

587
00:43:48,226 --> 00:43:51,951
You know, people walk around<br/>like this is all something.

588
00:43:51,998 --> 00:43:54,292
They'rfucking laughing

589
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:56,190
And nobody takes<br/>even one second

590
00:43:56,326 --> 00:43:58,061
To think about<br/>what's really going on.

591
00:43:58,166 --> 00:44:00,130
You sound<br/>depressed again.

592
00:44:00,197 --> 00:44:03,403
How can anybody not be?<br/>You'd have to be fucking nuts

593
00:44:03,535 --> 00:44:05,331
Not to be.

594
00:44:05,408 --> 00:44:08,302
I mean, you'd have to have<br/>your head wedged so far

595
00:44:08,376 --> 00:44:10,302
Up your ass that all<br/>you could see

596
00:44:10,377 --> 00:44:12,541
Is your own stupid face.

597
00:44:12,675 --> 00:44:14,480
What specifically<br/>are you talking about?

598
00:44:14,545 --> 00:44:18,150
I mean, everything<br/>is so fucked up.

599
00:44:22,086 --> 00:44:24,923
Why can't we all<br/>just get along?

600
00:44:30,965 --> 00:44:33,803
You don't have to<br/>chew it.

601
00:44:35,307 --> 00:44:37,471
You just wash it down<br/>like a pill.

602
00:46:45,367 --> 00:46:48,460
It's the same principle<br/>as the solar system.

603
00:46:55,148 --> 00:46:58,473
No more bets.

604
00:47:00,386 --> 00:47:03,081
- 24.<br/>- Yes.

605
00:47:04,217 --> 00:47:05,750
Nice.

606
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:13,920
Press it all.

607
00:47:23,567 --> 00:47:25,770
No more bets.

608
00:47:31,046 --> 00:47:32,870
20.

609
00:47:32,945 --> 00:47:35,713
Holy fucking shit.

610
00:47:42,458 --> 00:47:44,893
Here.

611
00:47:44,958 --> 00:47:46,952
Much appreciated.

612
00:47:59,136 --> 00:48:01,873
<i>No more bets.</i>

613
00:48:15,788 --> 00:48:18,122
24 again.

614
00:48:28,506 --> 00:48:31,531
- He's dead.<br/>- What?

615
00:48:31,607 --> 00:48:33,603
What?

616
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:47,251
What?

617
00:50:10,336 --> 00:50:12,200
I get it.

618
00:50:19,777 --> 00:50:23,081
I get it!
