02:07.360 --> 02:09.830
Just get me home.


NOTE Mama


02:11.960 --> 02:14.110
Just get me home.

02:14.320 --> 02:16.710
I'll do the rest.

05:19.560 --> 05:22.710
Yes, hello, this is David Linn
from <i>The New York Times.</i>

05:22.920 --> 05:26.440
May I speak with Susan,
please? Thank you.

05:30.120 --> 05:32.320
Hi, Susan, it's David again.

05:32.480 --> 05:35.630
I was just calling to see if we can set--

05:35.800 --> 05:40.000
Well, yes. Well, I figured
we'd have to do the interview by phone,

05:40.160 --> 05:42.200
since they've already left New York.

05:42.400 --> 05:46.080
But what we'd really love to get
is a photo of Mr. and Mrs. Schwartz

05:46.280 --> 05:48.270
to go along with the article.

05:48.440 --> 05:52.150
When are they scheduled
to get home?

05:53.640 --> 05:58.320
Oh, so they'll be home
tonight. Gotcha.

05:58.480 --> 06:03.510
Now, the address I have on them
is Upper Canyon Road. Is that still...?

06:03.680 --> 06:06.830
No, it isn't. They've--
Oh, let me get a pen.

06:07.960 --> 06:09.920
Where do they...?

06:10.080 --> 06:12.990
Tesuque. I see.

06:13.160 --> 06:14.990
And the address?

06:17.320 --> 06:21.600
Is that up near the opera house?
I hear that's nice.

06:22.440 --> 06:24.910
Well, I'll be in contact
with my photographer

06:25.080 --> 06:27.120
to check on his schedule.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.120
No, no, it's their call.

06:30.080 --> 06:32.960
I know how busy
Mr. and Mrs. Schwartz are.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.510
Thank you.

06:34.680 --> 06:38.040
This should make one hell of a story.

06:38.200 --> 06:40.320
Goodbye.

06:55.560 --> 06:59.190
<i>I'm just saying,
it's apples and oranges.</i>

07:00.080 --> 07:01.830
Listen, I maintain,

07:02.000 --> 07:04.470
if I want pizza,

07:04.640 --> 07:06.440
I go to a pizza place.
Yeah.

07:06.600 --> 07:09.590
If I want Thai,
I go to a Thai place.

07:09.760 --> 07:13.800
What is the point in comparing
Did I marry you?

07:13.960 --> 07:16.240
pizza to Thai?
What has happened?

07:16.400 --> 07:18.520
- This is different.
- They're completely--

07:18.680 --> 07:21.040
Oh, come on,
are you the man I married?

07:21.200 --> 07:25.240
I am the guy who wants to end
this ridiculous conversation,

07:25.400 --> 07:28.870
kick off my shoes, and have
a very large glass of wine.

07:29.040 --> 07:33.160
Well, I'm gonna tell you
to be my guest.

07:34.920 --> 07:35.960
All right, wait.

07:36.120 --> 07:40.160
The answer is 21.

07:40.320 --> 07:41.830
No.
Yes.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.390
Yes, because it has history.

07:44.560 --> 07:46.040
Come on.

07:46.200 --> 07:47.600
Prohibition.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.190
The <i>Sweet Smell of Success.</i>

07:49.400 --> 07:51.150
And Per Se has Thomas Keller.

07:51.360 --> 07:52.590
Game, set, and match.

07:52.760 --> 07:54.750
The whole vibe is so Yountville.

07:54.920 --> 07:56.910
You transplant it to Manhattan--

07:57.120 --> 07:59.680
Transplant it to Islamabad,
I would eat there.

07:59.840 --> 08:01.270
Oh, there's a good thought.

08:01.440 --> 08:02.480
What, Islamabad?

08:02.680 --> 08:04.400
No, Napa. We have to go to Napa.

08:04.560 --> 08:08.000
Oh, my God, all this talk of food.
Do you think Juana left us anything?

08:10.200 --> 08:12.560
She doesn't think we're coming back
until Wednesday.

08:12.760 --> 08:15.360
Unless you told her.
No, I haven't talked to her.

08:15.520 --> 08:17.720
Oh, look, here.

08:17.880 --> 08:20.400
Just a pear, that'll be perfect.
Yeah.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.830
You wanna get us
a nice bottle of wine?

08:23.040 --> 08:24.110
Mm-hm.

08:24.320 --> 08:26.310
Do you think we have any of those--?

08:26.520 --> 08:29.910
What are those crackers with,
like, the sun-dried tomato,

08:30.080 --> 08:33.390
and they were slightly peppery,
but not too peppery.

08:33.560 --> 08:36.080
- We don't have them?
- No.

08:36.920 --> 08:37.960
Ask Juana.

08:38.200 --> 08:39.430
We haven't had them in forever.

08:39.600 --> 08:43.150
I don't know why she doesn't get those.
Why don't you talk to her?

08:43.320 --> 08:45.520
She's got that thing with her daughter.

08:45.680 --> 08:47.750
Anyway, Napa?
Yeah.

08:47.960 --> 08:50.160
How long since we've been?
Two years.

08:50.360 --> 08:52.190
Jesus, that's two years.

08:52.360 --> 08:54.590
Yeah, too long, right?
Is this okay?

08:54.800 --> 08:56.520
Oh, that looks <i>p e r fe c to.</i>

08:56.720 --> 08:59.680
You wanna get the fireplace?

09:00.840 --> 09:02.120
Is it good?
Mm-hm.

09:02.280 --> 09:03.920
Is it ripe?
Mm-hm.

09:04.080 --> 09:06.280
Yeah.

09:06.480 --> 09:09.920
We could invite George and Delores.
They could come up from Marin.

09:10.080 --> 09:12.070
And Bill and Miriam Cohen.

09:12.280 --> 09:16.040
We could have a little
spa action, right?

09:16.240 --> 09:18.470
And then we could do
some sort of wine, and then--

09:27.960 --> 09:30.030
Hello, Gretchen.

09:30.200 --> 09:32.190
Elliott.

09:33.960 --> 09:36.520
I really like your new house.

09:38.680 --> 09:40.350
Walt.

09:42.240 --> 09:44.230
This...

09:50.720 --> 09:52.760
Are we looking east?

09:53.600 --> 09:54.830
Oh...

09:55.040 --> 09:59.800
My God, you must have one great view
of the Sangre de Cristos.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.040
Walt,

10:01.280 --> 10:03.590
what are you doing here?

10:05.240 --> 10:07.760
I saw you on <i>Charlie Rose.</i>

10:08.760 --> 10:10.320
You looked great.

10:12.160 --> 10:15.950
You both did.
If you are here to--

10:16.120 --> 10:18.110
To hurt us--

10:18.320 --> 10:21.280
Walt, whatever it is
you're planning--

10:21.440 --> 10:24.160
Actually, I'm here
to give you something.

10:26.600 --> 10:28.560
It's out in my car.

10:29.080 --> 10:33.310
How about the three of us take a walk
to it? It's just parked down the road.

10:33.480 --> 10:36.040
I couldn't get it past your gate.

10:43.680 --> 10:47.640
Elliott, if we're gonna go that way,

10:47.800 --> 10:50.320
you'll need a bigger knife.

11:00.720 --> 11:02.920
Keep stacking. It'll all fit.

11:09.960 --> 11:12.270
That's all right.

11:12.480 --> 11:15.710
Yeah, just throw it on top.

11:18.280 --> 11:22.240
Gretchen, would you mind? We don't
want to lose any under the furniture.

11:25.520 --> 11:27.110
All right.

11:28.080 --> 11:32.310
That is $9,720,000.

11:32.480 --> 11:36.080
Where did it come from?
And why is it here?

11:36.960 --> 11:39.870
I earned it, and you're going to
give it to my children.

11:40.040 --> 11:41.950
What? Why?
Walt, I don't think we--

11:42.120 --> 11:44.030
On my son's 18th birthday,

11:44.200 --> 11:47.990
which is 10 months
and two days from today,

11:48.160 --> 11:50.150
you will give him this money,

11:50.320 --> 11:52.440
in the form of an irrevocable trust.

11:52.600 --> 11:57.470
You will tell him that it is his
to do with as he sees fit,

11:57.640 --> 12:02.510
but with the hope that he uses it
for his college education.

12:02.680 --> 12:07.910
And for the betterment of his family.
Walt, I'm not sure that we follow.

12:08.120 --> 12:09.790
Why...?

12:09.960 --> 12:12.320
I mean, why, in particular,
would we--?

12:12.480 --> 12:15.630
If you wanna give your kids
drug money, go do it yourself.

12:15.800 --> 12:17.150
I can't.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.550
My wife and son hate me.

12:19.720 --> 12:22.280
They won't take my money.

12:22.440 --> 12:23.950
Even if they did,

12:24.120 --> 12:27.110
the federal government
wouldn't let them.

12:28.680 --> 12:33.280
But two rich benefactors who are known
for their charitable endeavors,

12:33.480 --> 12:37.600
who would think nothing of,
for instance, writing a $28 million check,

12:37.760 --> 12:41.390
to help victims
of methamphetamine abuse?

12:41.560 --> 12:44.790
I have to think that your money
would be very welcome.

12:44.960 --> 12:47.240
It wouldn't make any sense
coming from us.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.120
It certainly would.

12:49.280 --> 12:53.800
My children are blameless victims
of their monstrous father.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.520
A man who you once knew
quite well.

13:02.800 --> 13:05.160
Call it a beau geste,
call it liberal guilt,

13:05.320 --> 13:07.550
call it whatever you want, but do it.

13:08.520 --> 13:15.120
And you are not to spend
a single dime of your own money.

13:15.280 --> 13:21.440
If there are taxes or lawyers' fees owed,
you will take it right from here.

13:21.600 --> 13:24.120
They use my money, never yours.

13:24.320 --> 13:25.960
Okay, Walt, sure.

13:26.120 --> 13:29.000
That sounds reasonable.

13:30.640 --> 13:32.360
So, what happens next?

13:33.200 --> 13:37.910
I guess we shake on it,
and I leave.

14:07.440 --> 14:09.880
I can trust you to do this.

14:10.040 --> 14:11.390
Yes.

14:11.560 --> 14:14.550
Absolutely, you can.

14:30.640 --> 14:33.310
Don't move. Don't--
Don't dare move a muscle.

14:33.480 --> 14:37.920
You don't want them to think that
you're trying to get away. Just breathe.

14:40.200 --> 14:43.190
Just this afternoon,
I had an extra $200,000

14:43.400 --> 14:47.080
that I would have loved dearly
to leave on top of this table.

14:48.600 --> 14:55.360
Instead, I gave it to the two best
hit men west of the Mississippi.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.640
Now,

14:57.800 --> 15:01.680
whatever happens to me tomorrow,

15:03.120 --> 15:05.350
they'll still be out there.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.080
Keeping tabs.

15:09.800 --> 15:10.840
And if,

15:11.120 --> 15:13.270
for any reason,

15:13.440 --> 15:17.400
that my children
do not get this money,

15:17.600 --> 15:22.070
a kind of countdown
will begin.

15:22.240 --> 15:25.870
Maybe a day or so later,
maybe a week, a year,

15:26.040 --> 15:30.830
when you're going for a walk in Santa
Fe or Manhattan or Prague, wherever,

15:31.000 --> 15:36.600
and you're talking
about your stock prices

15:38.440 --> 15:41.670
without a worry in the world.

15:42.680 --> 15:44.990
And then suddenly,

15:45.160 --> 15:48.310
you'll hear the scrape
of a footstep behind you,

15:48.480 --> 15:50.520
but before you can
even turn around:

15:50.760 --> 15:51.800
Pop!

15:57.640 --> 15:59.630
Darkness.

16:05.680 --> 16:08.750
Cheer up, beautiful people.

16:10.560 --> 16:13.360
This is where you get to make it right.

17:01.480 --> 17:03.120
Oh, yeah, right.

17:11.560 --> 17:14.550
You know, I don't exactly know
how to feel about all this.

17:14.760 --> 17:15.880
For real, yo.

17:16.040 --> 17:20.160
Whole thing felt kind of shady,
you know, like, morality-wise?

17:20.320 --> 17:22.310
Totally.

17:23.840 --> 17:25.990
How do you feel now?

17:27.720 --> 17:30.710
Better.
Yeah, definitely improving.

17:31.720 --> 17:33.070
What's this I hear

17:33.320 --> 17:35.440
about blue meth
still being out there?

17:36.640 --> 17:37.680
What do you mean?

17:37.880 --> 17:39.600
Have you heard anything?

17:39.760 --> 17:42.070
Is it still being sold?

17:44.280 --> 17:45.840
Yeah.

17:50.960 --> 17:52.310
By whom?

17:53.280 --> 17:54.840
It's you, right?

17:55.840 --> 17:57.590
I mean, aren't you
still cooking?

18:01.080 --> 18:02.280
Damn, man.

18:02.440 --> 18:04.000
We were sure it was you,

18:04.200 --> 18:05.550
because that shit is choice, yo.

18:05.720 --> 18:06.950
Better than ever.

18:07.120 --> 18:10.240
I mean, um, you know.

18:11.800 --> 18:14.080
Jesse.
Seriously?

18:14.280 --> 18:17.640
You said he moved to Alaska.
That's what I heard.

18:17.800 --> 18:19.030
Right on, Jesse.

18:19.240 --> 18:20.750
Passing the torch.

18:20.920 --> 18:24.630
Damn, man, couldn't he at least
throw a brother a bone?

20:06.440 --> 20:08.080
Whoa, what happened there?

20:10.120 --> 20:11.470
It's my birthday.

20:11.640 --> 20:14.030
Yeah? Well, happy birthday.

21:02.280 --> 21:07.510
It's easy money. Till we catch you. Say
the word, I'll take you on a ride-along.

21:07.680 --> 21:10.350
You can watch us
knock down a meth lab.

21:10.520 --> 21:12.480
Get a little excitement
in your life. Heh, heh.

21:13.160 --> 21:15.360
Yeah, someday.

21:42.520 --> 21:45.560
Welcome. Would you like a menu?
No, thank you.

21:45.720 --> 21:49.270
Chamomile tea with soy milk, please.
All right, you got it.

22:04.920 --> 22:07.150
Hey, how you doing?

22:07.320 --> 22:08.910
Good.

22:09.080 --> 22:11.390
How's things?

22:11.600 --> 22:13.110
Hey, I like your...

22:15.520 --> 22:16.840
Shirt.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.830
My blouse?
Nice. Yeah, I like the color.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.830
That's a nice color on you.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.510
It's kind of a--

22:24.680 --> 22:29.440
I don't know exactly what you'd call it.
It's kind of a cornflower blue.

22:29.600 --> 22:32.990
Before you say or do anything,
just hear me out.

22:34.480 --> 22:36.360
Todd.
Nobody knows that I'm here.

22:36.520 --> 22:40.880
Just listen for two minutes,
and then I'll leave. Please.

22:41.080 --> 22:42.560
No. Please.

22:42.720 --> 22:46.160
Just two minutes of your time.
That's all I ask.

22:48.280 --> 22:49.320
Please.

22:55.640 --> 22:58.110
You're running out of
methylamine, aren't you?

22:58.280 --> 23:00.480
I can do the math.

23:00.640 --> 23:04.110
You've been at it long enough.
You must be running low.

23:05.120 --> 23:08.000
I have a new method

23:08.160 --> 23:10.120
that requires no methylamine.

23:10.320 --> 23:14.870
It's easy, and it will keep you in business.
And, Todd, I could teach it to you.

23:15.080 --> 23:17.640
How did you know
to find us here?

23:18.320 --> 23:19.800
Ten a.m.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.150
Every Tuesday morning,
you and I met here.

23:23.320 --> 23:26.840
You're rather
schedule-oriented, I guess.

23:41.120 --> 23:42.550
Sorry.

23:49.560 --> 23:51.360
I need the money.

23:52.400 --> 23:55.950
I've spent almost all of mine already,

23:56.160 --> 24:00.150
just trying to stay
one step ahead of the police.

24:00.320 --> 24:03.040
Mr. White, I don't think there's--

24:03.200 --> 24:06.190
How much would it cost us?

24:08.000 --> 24:09.750
Nothing short of a million.

24:09.920 --> 24:12.070
And believe me, for this,

24:12.280 --> 24:14.190
that is giving it away.

24:15.200 --> 24:16.920
I think Jack should hear this.

24:17.080 --> 24:18.400
Yeah, I don't know.

24:18.600 --> 24:24.710
Now, listen, I can come up
there tonight and talk to him.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.630
He'd get it.

24:26.800 --> 24:29.790
This is a win-win situation.

24:30.400 --> 24:33.280
Hi, what can I get for you two?
He's just leaving.

24:33.440 --> 24:36.160
Good seeing you again.
Take care.

24:39.760 --> 24:41.270
For you?

24:41.440 --> 24:42.510
I'm good.

24:42.680 --> 24:44.910
And I need more stevia.

24:54.720 --> 24:57.870
Okay, no disrespect to the man,
but doing business with him?

24:58.040 --> 24:59.080
Right now, that's not--

24:59.240 --> 25:02.040
Of course we're not
doing business with him.

25:03.560 --> 25:05.150
Todd, please.

25:05.320 --> 25:07.520
Don't make me walk you through this.

25:11.600 --> 25:14.590
Jesus. Did you look at him?

25:16.400 --> 25:18.550
You'd be doing him a favor.

27:04.600 --> 27:07.960
<i>Hello, please record after the tone.</i>

27:09.480 --> 27:11.200
<i>Truce, all right?</i>

27:11.400 --> 27:14.470
<i>Skyler, I have news about Walt,
and you need to hear it,</i>

27:14.640 --> 27:16.760
<i>so if you're there, pick up.</i>

27:17.920 --> 27:19.480
<i>Skyler--</i>

27:20.480 --> 27:22.280
Hey.

27:22.960 --> 27:24.710
What's up?

27:24.880 --> 27:26.630
<i>Walt's in town.</i>

27:27.320 --> 27:28.360
Yeah?

27:28.520 --> 27:31.120
That car they thought he stole
in New Hampshire,

27:31.280 --> 27:34.480
they found it in a Denny's
parking lot right on Central.

27:34.640 --> 27:38.110
<i>And your next-door neighbor,
on the right-- What's her name, Becky?</i>

27:38.280 --> 27:41.830
Becky's on the left. Carol's on the right.
<i>Becky, Carol, whatever.</i>

27:42.000 --> 27:44.470
<i>She saw him at your old house.</i>

27:44.680 --> 27:46.830
Just this morning, plain as day.

27:47.000 --> 27:51.550
He's there, walking out of your house,
and he calls her by name.

27:51.720 --> 27:56.110
He didn't hurt her, did he? He didn't--?
No, he's just like, "Hey, Becky!"

27:56.320 --> 27:59.040
Or Carol, whatever.

27:59.200 --> 28:01.640
<i>She said he looked exactly
like the Unabomber.</i>

28:01.800 --> 28:05.560
But she's positive it was him.
They're getting calls from all over town.

28:05.720 --> 28:08.680
He's here, he's there,
he's going to blow up city hall.

28:08.840 --> 28:11.880
He has some sort of manifesto.
He wants to be on the news.

28:12.080 --> 28:15.550
Who's making these calls? Him?
<i>There are two or three voices.</i>

28:15.720 --> 28:19.400
<i>They're not sure if they're crank calls
or people he's put up to it,</i>

28:19.560 --> 28:21.600
<i>or if they're actual anonymous tips.</i>

28:21.800 --> 28:24.630
<i>It's stretching them thin,
which is maybe the point.</i>

28:24.800 --> 28:26.150
<i>As far as I'm concerned,</i>

28:26.320 --> 28:30.230
there are three places that he would go:
To you, to me, or Flynn.

28:30.400 --> 28:31.960
<i>Right.</i>

28:32.120 --> 28:33.870
They're watching the high school.

28:34.040 --> 28:37.270
They're probably watching
your place too.

28:37.480 --> 28:38.990
I mean,

28:39.800 --> 28:42.270
I know that's what Hank would do.

28:42.440 --> 28:47.150
There is no way Walt's getting to you.
They are absolutely going to catch him.

28:47.320 --> 28:48.440
No doubt about it.

28:48.600 --> 28:52.440
That arrogant asshole thinks he's some
criminal mastermind, but he's not.

28:53.120 --> 28:55.030
<i>But on the off chance...</i>

28:55.200 --> 28:57.110
Yeah.

28:57.280 --> 29:01.070
On the million-to-one chance,

29:02.280 --> 29:03.950
you be on the lookout, okay?

29:08.440 --> 29:10.030
Thanks.

29:12.920 --> 29:14.800
You got it.

29:33.200 --> 29:35.270
Five minutes.

29:42.280 --> 29:44.030
Five minutes.

29:50.040 --> 29:53.670
You didn't kill anybody
sneaking in here, did you?

29:55.360 --> 29:58.080
You didn't hurt anybody?
No.

29:58.680 --> 30:00.190
Didn't have to.

30:12.520 --> 30:13.950
You look terrible.

30:15.400 --> 30:17.070
Yeah.

30:18.520 --> 30:20.030
But I feel good.

30:21.920 --> 30:23.910
So talk.

30:26.360 --> 30:27.870
Why are you here?

30:38.560 --> 30:40.310
It's over.

30:41.760 --> 30:45.070
And I needed
a proper goodbye.

30:46.080 --> 30:48.310
Not our last phone call.

30:49.880 --> 30:52.680
So you're going to the police?

30:54.880 --> 30:56.630
They'll be coming to me.

30:56.800 --> 30:59.240
If you're in custody,

31:01.320 --> 31:04.200
what stops those people
from coming back?

31:04.360 --> 31:05.920
When--

31:06.080 --> 31:09.520
When I still had the house,

31:09.720 --> 31:12.240
three men came
in the middle of the night,

31:12.400 --> 31:15.150
wearing masks, threatening
Holly and Flynn and me.

31:15.320 --> 31:18.520
They told me not to talk about
that woman at the car wash,

31:18.680 --> 31:20.480
and if you're in custody--

31:20.640 --> 31:23.600
They're not coming back.
Not after tonight.

31:24.600 --> 31:26.430
What's tonight?

31:32.480 --> 31:35.470
We don't want your money, Walt.

31:36.840 --> 31:39.120
I thought Flynn made that clear.

31:39.280 --> 31:40.950
He did.

31:41.480 --> 31:44.120
And I don't have any to give you.

31:44.720 --> 31:47.390
I spent the last of it getting here.

31:49.120 --> 31:51.920
All I have to give you

31:52.760 --> 31:54.430
is this.

32:05.720 --> 32:07.870
Call the DEA once I leave.

32:08.040 --> 32:12.240
Tell them I was here.
That I forced my way in.

32:12.400 --> 32:13.990
Tell them...

32:16.920 --> 32:21.040
Tell them I wanted
bacon and eggs on my birthday,

32:22.040 --> 32:24.400
and that I gave you that ticket.

32:25.520 --> 32:27.990
Those numbers
are GPS coordinates.

32:29.480 --> 32:31.630
For what?

32:34.320 --> 32:36.520
A burial site.

32:37.400 --> 32:40.680
That's where they'll
find Hank and Steve Gomez.

32:44.160 --> 32:46.800
It's where I buried our money.

32:47.800 --> 32:50.360
And the men who stole it from us,

32:50.520 --> 32:52.720
the men who still have it,

32:53.480 --> 32:55.710
they murdered Hank and Steve

32:55.880 --> 32:58.950
and put them in that hole.

33:00.400 --> 33:02.550
Now, you trade that

33:02.720 --> 33:05.160
for a deal with the prosecutor.

33:05.320 --> 33:07.990
You get yourself out of this.

33:08.160 --> 33:10.070
Skyler.

33:12.760 --> 33:14.510
Skyler.

33:17.560 --> 33:20.200
All the things that I did,

33:21.400 --> 33:25.080
you need to understand--
If I have to hear

33:25.240 --> 33:27.440
one more time

33:27.600 --> 33:30.560
that you did this for the family--

33:30.720 --> 33:32.840
I did it for me.

33:39.480 --> 33:41.440
I liked it.

33:44.360 --> 33:46.960
I was good at it.

33:48.640 --> 33:50.280
And

33:51.200 --> 33:52.790
I was

33:53.800 --> 33:55.600
really...

34:00.520 --> 34:02.670
I was alive.

34:41.680 --> 34:44.640
Flynn will be home soon.

34:46.080 --> 34:48.070
Before I go,

34:50.600 --> 34:52.750
may I see her?

37:32.440 --> 37:34.080
Whoo.

37:36.680 --> 37:38.880
Damn, man, this thing's a classic.

37:39.040 --> 37:40.190
What block you got in it?

37:40.440 --> 37:43.350
The 500 or the 425?

37:45.200 --> 37:47.160
Couldn't tell you.

37:52.040 --> 37:53.630
Well...

37:54.280 --> 37:55.870
Five hundred.

37:56.920 --> 37:59.040
That's the one you want.

37:59.200 --> 38:02.430
No replacement for displacement.

38:12.640 --> 38:14.070
Where to?

38:14.240 --> 38:15.280
To the clubhouse.

38:32.360 --> 38:35.640
Go ahead, just park it
right in front over here.

38:37.440 --> 38:41.880
No, no, no, just straight in, man.
Just-- What are--?

38:42.160 --> 38:44.720
All right, fine, here, whatever.

38:55.720 --> 38:58.710
Hey, how you doing?

38:59.120 --> 39:02.110
Turn around,
put your arms out like this.

39:22.920 --> 39:25.720
While you're at it,
why don't you lift your shirt up,

39:25.920 --> 39:27.240
give us a spin?

39:28.560 --> 39:30.710
Christ, I'm not wearing a wire.

39:45.680 --> 39:47.190
Okay?

39:48.960 --> 39:52.840
My wallet and keys?
Yeah, you'll get them back. Just relax.

40:04.920 --> 40:06.350
Stay here.

40:06.520 --> 40:08.640
Keep your eyes open.

40:10.320 --> 40:13.840
Jesus, look at you with
that head of hair. Is that real?

40:14.000 --> 40:15.400
Yes.

40:15.600 --> 40:18.830
That's not a wig? Seriously?
No.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.520
What were you doing before,
shaving it?

40:22.480 --> 40:23.520
Yes.

40:23.680 --> 40:26.510
Christ, that is one fine
head of hair.

40:26.680 --> 40:28.990
I mean, otherwise,
you look like shit, but--

40:29.160 --> 40:33.630
Hello to you too, Jack.
Now, can we talk business?

40:33.800 --> 40:35.870
I don't think so, no.

40:36.880 --> 40:40.110
Did Todd tell you what I'm offering?
Yeah, he told me.

40:40.280 --> 40:44.190
The thing is
we're not really in the market.

40:46.360 --> 40:48.590
You're low on methylamine.
What happens then?

40:49.320 --> 40:50.550
No, we'll get more.

40:51.680 --> 40:55.070
That Quayle woman's got her own setup.
The heat's off her.

40:55.240 --> 40:58.550
She can break loose a barrel.
It ain't broke, so why fix it?

40:58.720 --> 41:01.440
Todd, please, would you
explain things to your uncle?

41:01.640 --> 41:04.160
Explain to him the benefit
of what I'm offering.

41:05.800 --> 41:08.870
You really shouldn't
have come back, Mr. White.

41:10.840 --> 41:12.830
I'm sorry.

41:15.480 --> 41:17.790
Wait. Jack.
Where do you want it?

41:17.960 --> 41:20.320
I don't know,
anywhere but my living room?

41:20.480 --> 41:23.150
Take him out back.
Jack, look, you owe me.

41:23.320 --> 41:24.720
You owe me.
Hey, hey, hey.

41:24.880 --> 41:26.470
Let's go.
I owe you, what for?

41:26.640 --> 41:30.030
Jesse Pinkman. You promised
you would kill him, and you didn't.

41:30.200 --> 41:32.510
Instead, you partnered with him.
All right.

41:32.680 --> 41:34.800
You're his partner now--
Whoa, stop.

41:42.760 --> 41:44.800
Partners? What are you
talking about?

41:44.960 --> 41:46.440
He's alive, isn't he?

41:46.600 --> 41:48.590
He's cooking for you.

41:48.760 --> 41:50.430
What, are you gonna lie?

41:51.480 --> 41:54.390
Him being alive
is not him and me being partners.

41:54.560 --> 41:56.310
Not by a damn sight.

41:56.480 --> 41:59.230
What, you think
I'd partner with a rat?

41:59.400 --> 42:00.800
Where is that little piece of shit?

42:01.080 --> 42:02.480
He's finishing up a batch.

42:02.640 --> 42:04.280
Go get him. Bring him here.

42:06.200 --> 42:07.550
Uncle Jack--
No. No, no, no.

42:07.720 --> 42:10.030
This one here, calling me a liar?

42:10.200 --> 42:13.110
He just insulted you,
he insulted me, all of us.

42:13.280 --> 42:17.240
Jesus. Hustle it up. Come on.
Let's get this over with.

42:18.520 --> 42:21.800
I'm gonna show you
just how wrong you are.

42:22.240 --> 42:25.360
Then I'm putting that bullet
in your head myself.

43:20.600 --> 43:23.990
Yeah, you see what I'm
talking about, you son of a bitch?

43:28.800 --> 43:30.760
Now, does this look
like a partner to you?

43:30.960 --> 43:32.870
Come here. Take a look.

43:33.880 --> 43:35.080
Come here!

43:46.720 --> 43:48.360
Take a look at him.

43:48.560 --> 43:50.630
Have a gander.

43:51.280 --> 43:52.920
This is my partner.

43:53.080 --> 43:55.830
Right, partner? Right, buddy?

43:57.440 --> 44:00.510
Hardworking, good partner.
Fifty-fifty partner.

44:04.280 --> 44:05.320
Can you hurry this shit up?

44:05.800 --> 44:06.840
Make it quick?

44:15.760 --> 44:18.510
Toddy, get him off, would you?
Yeah, Toddy, get them both off.

45:35.640 --> 45:37.280
Uncle Jack.

45:55.520 --> 45:57.480
Jesus.

45:58.960 --> 46:00.470
Mr. White.

47:11.120 --> 47:13.430
Wait. Wait.

47:21.640 --> 47:23.710
You want your money, right?

47:25.720 --> 47:28.000
You wanna know where it is?

47:29.320 --> 47:31.680
You pull that trigger, you'll never--

48:21.680 --> 48:23.190
Do it.

48:31.720 --> 48:33.920
You want this.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.310
Say the words.

48:38.760 --> 48:41.670
Say you want this!

48:42.840 --> 48:46.520
Nothing happens until I hear you say it.

48:48.840 --> 48:50.910
I want this.

49:13.800 --> 49:15.680
Then do it yourself.

49:46.600 --> 49:48.960
Pick up the phone.

49:52.080 --> 49:53.750
<i>Hello?</i>

49:54.120 --> 49:56.190
Is it done?

49:56.360 --> 49:57.870
Is he gone?

49:58.120 --> 50:00.110
<i>Yeah, it's done.</i>

50:00.480 --> 50:02.520
<i>He's gone.</i>

50:03.040 --> 50:04.270
<i>They're all gone.</i>

50:04.480 --> 50:07.630
Todd? Who is this?

50:08.480 --> 50:10.150
It's Walt.

50:11.240 --> 50:12.910
How are you feeling?

50:13.640 --> 50:15.870
Kind of under the weather?

50:16.040 --> 50:18.760
Like you've got the flu?

50:18.920 --> 50:21.070
That would be
the ricin I gave you.

50:21.760 --> 50:26.790
<i>I slipped it into that stevia crap
that you're always putting in your tea.</i>

50:27.000 --> 50:28.800
Oh, my God.

50:32.000 --> 50:33.800
Well,

50:36.000 --> 50:38.070
goodbye, Lydia.
